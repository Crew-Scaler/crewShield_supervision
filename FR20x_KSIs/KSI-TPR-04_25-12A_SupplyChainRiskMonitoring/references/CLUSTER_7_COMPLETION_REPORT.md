## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. EU AI Act Dominates Research
The EU AI Act is by far the most researched regulatory framework (38 papers), with significant focus on:
- Implementation challenges and solutions
- Compliance automation tools
- High-risk system classification
- Documentation requirements
- Stakeholder alignment (practitioners, experts, end-users)

### 2. Integration of Regulatory + AI Security
Strong trend toward unified frameworks that address both:
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- AI-specific security concerns (adversarial robustness, hallucinations, bias)
- Vulnerability management in automated systems

### 3. Automation & Tooling
Emerging research on:
- Automated compliance checking (COMPL-AI, Compliance Cards)
- Evidence generation and audit trails
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Machine-readable documentation

### 4. Vulnerability Management in AI
Specific focus on:
- AI system vulnerability identification
- Supply chain security for AI components
- Cryptographic evidence structures for regulated workflows
- Integration with traditional vulnerability management

### 5. Multi-Framework Alignment
Papers address alignment between:
- EU AI Act ↔ NIST AI RMF
- NIST AI RMF ↔ ISO 42001
- EU AI Act ↔ ISO/IEC standards
- FedRAMP ↔ Cloud AI systems

## NOTABLE GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Limited Research on PCI DSS for AI
Only 4 papers directly address PCI DSS, mostly older approaches. Opportunity for:
- Modern AI approaches to PCI DSS compliance
- ML-based vulnerability detection in payment systems
- Integration of AI with traditional payment security

### 2. Agentic AI Regulation Still Emerging
5 papers address agentic/autonomous AI, indicating:
- Rapidly evolving regulatory landscape
- Need for clearer guidance on AI agent governance
- Vulnerability assessment for autonomous systems

### 3. Cross-Framework Implementation Guidance
Limited practical guidance on:
- Choosing between frameworks for specific contexts
- Simultaneous compliance with multiple regulations
- Resource-constrained implementations

### 4. Real-World Implementation Case Studies
Most papers are theoretical/framework-focused, lacking:
- Large-scale implementation experiences
- Failure modes and lessons learned
- ROI and cost-benefit analyses

---
