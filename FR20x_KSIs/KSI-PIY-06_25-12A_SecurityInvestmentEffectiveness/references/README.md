## Key Findings Summary

### Burnout Crisis Validated
- **44%** severe burnout (72% total at-risk)
- **66%** perceive cybersecurity as more stressful than other IT roles
- Primary drivers: demanding roles, unsupportive culture, understaffing

### Automation as Force Multiplier
- **70%+** reduction in manual workload with automation
- **AI/LLM** tools can handle alert triage, incident response, configuration validation
- **Human oversight** still required for critical decisions

### Misconfiguration = Staffing Problem
- **823** real-world misconfiguration incidents analyzed
- **82%** of breaches from human error (per industry data)
- **62** security smell categories in IaC alone
- **Complexity** of cloud environments exceeds human capacity without automation
