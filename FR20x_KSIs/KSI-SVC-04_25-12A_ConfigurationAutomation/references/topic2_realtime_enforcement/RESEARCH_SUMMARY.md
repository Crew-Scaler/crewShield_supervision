### 1. A Novel Zero-Trust Identity Framework for Agentic AI [Score: 96]
**Authors:** Ken Huang, Vineeth Sai Narajala, John Yeoh
**ArXiv ID:** 2505.19301v2
**Year:** 2025
**File:** `01_2505.19301_v2.pdf`

**Abstract:** Traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, primarily designed for human users or static machine identities via protocols such as OAuth, fall short when applied to agentic AI systems, which dynamically interact with a diverse range of services and resources without explicit human oversight. This paper proposes a novel Zero-Trust identity framework tailored for agentic AI, introducing decentralized authentication and fine-grained access control mechanisms that address the unique security challenges posed by autonomous agents.

**Key Relevance:**
- Zero-Trust architecture for autonomous agents
- Decentralized authentication mechanisms
- Fine-grained access control for agent actions
- Dynamic identity management during runtime
