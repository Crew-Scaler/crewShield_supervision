**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets
**Research Basis:** 211 papers synthesized into 8 thematic clusters emphasizing: AI-Powered Password Attacks & Cracking (45 papers), AI Social Engineering & Deepfake Threats (45 papers, focused on passwordless defenses), Biometric & Behavioral Authentication (30+ papers, as passwordless factors), Non-Human Identity & AI Agent Governance (36 papers), Passwordless Technologies & Standards (40 papers), Cryptographic Defenses (20+ papers), Identity Federation & Access Control (15+ papers), AI Anomaly Detection & Behavioral Monitoring (15+ papers). Key findings validated: Password obsolescence (85.6% crackable in <10 seconds with PassGAN), FIDO2 phishing resistance (99.9%), non-human identity proliferation (82:1 ratio, projected 2,000:1 by 2026), credential sprawl (23.7M secrets exposed on GitHub 2024), SPIFFE/SPIRE short-lived token effectiveness (reducing lateral movement window from months to minutes), behavioral anomaly detection accuracy (95-98%).
