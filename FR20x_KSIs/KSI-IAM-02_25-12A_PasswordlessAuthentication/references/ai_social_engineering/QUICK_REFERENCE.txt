CRITICAL STATISTICS
-------------------
- 29,000,000 stealer logs in 2024
- 19,131 real-world phishing sites analyzed
- 40% growth in phishing attacks (single year)
- 93-95% LLM brand identification accuracy
- 0% advantage from complex personalization

TOP 5 MUST-READ PAPERS (Direct Credential Theft)
-------------------------------------------------
1. 2507.23611v1 - LLM-Based Infostealer Detection (29M logs)
2. 2505.23634v1 - MCP Safety Training (credential theft)
3. 2509.00005v1 - Email Authorship (business email compromise)
4. 2511.21448v1 - Labeled Email Dataset (LLM phishing)
5. 2508.12175v1 - Promptware Attacks (LLM assistants)

KEY FINDINGS
------------
✓ LLM-generated phishing: HIGHLY EFFECTIVE (professional quality)
✓ AI personalization: LESS CRITICAL than expected (generic works)
✓ Voice cloning: VALIDATED (scalable vishing threat)
✓ Automated campaigns: MASSIVE SCALE (29M logs, self-evolving)
✓ Behavioral mimicry: EXPLOITS INTERNAL TRUST

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
---------------------------
1. Deploy LLM-based phishing detection (93-95% accuracy)
2. Implement internal email authorship validation
3. Address infostealer threat at scale (automated analysis)
4. Secure AI agent systems (prompt injection)
5. Plan voice authentication replacement

ATTACK SCENARIOS
----------------
1. Automated Credential Harvesting: Jailbreak → Phish → Infostealer (29M)
2. Business Email Compromise: Initial → Lateral → Escalate
3. Voice Phishing: LLM+TTS+ASR → Automated Vishing → Auth Bypass
4. AI Agent Exploitation: Prompt Injection → Credential Access → Exfiltration

DEFENSE PRIORITY
----------------
NOW:        LLM detection, Infostealer detection, Email validation
6-12 MONTHS: Voice defenses, AI agent security, MCP security
12+ MONTHS:  Self-evolving defenses, Multi-modal, Zero-trust AI

ALL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED ✓
