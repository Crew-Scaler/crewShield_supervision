   - Well-designed generic content equally effective
   - Simple "direct-profile" strategy sufficient
   - Evidence: 2512.01893v1 (controlled study)
   - Implication: Attackers don't need sophisticated profiling

3. Deepfake & Voice Synthesis Effectiveness: VALIDATED
   - LLM + TTS + ASR = scalable, convincing vishing

   - Evidence: 2507.23611v1 (29M logs), 2507.21538v1 (genetic algorithms)

5. Behavioral Mimicry & Trust Exploitation: VALIDATED
   - Organizations trust internal emails - exploited
   - Business email compromise enables lateral movement
   - AI agents create new trust-based attack surface
   - Evidence: 2509.00005v1 (email authorship), 2506.07153v2 (web agents)

CRITICAL FINDINGS VALIDATION
-----------------------------

✓ Finding 1: 29M stealer logs demonstrate massive credential compromise
  Source: 2507.23611v1.pdf
  Impact: Manual analysis unfeasible, automated LLM analysis required

✓ Finding 2: LLM-generated phishing eliminates traditional indicators
  Source: 2510.11915v1.pdf, 2509.07287v1.pdf
  Impact: No grammar/spelling errors, detection systems struggle

✓ Finding 3: Business email compromise exploits internal trust
  Source: 2509.00005v1.pdf
  Impact: Organizations trust internal emails by default - major vulnerability

✓ Finding 4: AI agents create new credential theft attack surface
  Source: 2509.22040v1.pdf, 2506.07153v2.pdf, 2506.23260v1.pdf
  Impact: System privileges + prompt injection = credential exposure

✓ Finding 5: Voice cloning enables scalable authentication bypass
  Source: 2506.11125v1.pdf, 2507.16291v1.pdf
  Impact: Voice biometrics vulnerable, limited defensive countermeasures
