RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS
================================================================================

Immediate (This Week):
1. Review TECHNICAL_ASSESSMENT.md for comprehensive threat analysis
2. Read 7 flagship papers (listed above)
3. Assess organizational readiness for FIDO2 deployment

Short-Term (This Month):

12. Evaluate biometric authentication requirements

================================================================================
KEY TAKEAWAYS
================================================================================

1. Passwordless authentication is ESSENTIAL for defending against AI-powered
   credential attacks. Traditional passwords are no longer defensible.

2. Zero trust architectures with continuous verification eliminate credential-
   based trust assumptions. This is CRITICAL for agentic AI systems.

3. Post-quantum cryptography must be implemented NOW to protect against
   future quantum computing threats (harvest-now-decrypt-later).

4. Biometric authentication requires anti-spoofing measures (liveness
   detection, multi-modal) to defend against AI-generated deepfakes.

5. Implementation must balance security and usability. Target security
   friction quotient: <1.0 (empirically validated).

6. Formal verification and security analysis are essential. Implementation
   details matter (e.g., CTAP vulnerabilities, optional channel binding).

7. The convergence of FIDO2 + Zero Trust + Post-Quantum provides the
   strongest defense against current and future credential attacks.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED with passwordless authentication implementation
immediately. The research evidence is overwhelming that passwordless systems
provide superior security against AI-powered attacks while improving user
experience.

Priority sequence:
1. FIDO2/WebAuthn (0-6 months) - Immediate risk reduction
2. Identity Control Plane (0-6 months) - Zero trust foundation
3. SPIFFE (6-12 months) - Eliminate secrets in workloads
4. Agentic JWT (6-12 months) - Secure AI agent authentication
5. Hybrid PQC (12-24 months) - Long-term quantum resistance

This research provides comprehensive technical foundation for eliminating
credential-based attacks and transitioning to passwordless, zero-trust
authentication architecture.
