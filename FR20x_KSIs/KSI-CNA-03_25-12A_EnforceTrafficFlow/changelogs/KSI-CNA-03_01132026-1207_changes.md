# Extracted Metadata and Statistics

Extracted on: 01132026-1207

**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets with filtering refinement
**Filtering Criteria:** Questions directly addressing traffic flow enforcement for AI agents; merged redundant sections; removed Q03-Q04 (merged into Q02), Q25 (merged into Q11), Q30-Q31 (crypto specifics moved to separate KSI), Q39 (distributed tracing moved to observability), Q40 (retention policy moved to logging KSI). Tightened focus on policy-driven enforcement, agent communication security, and edge-cloud traffic controls.

**Total Questions:** 30 (down from 40)
**Sections:** 7 (merged Kubernetes-specific into general network policies section)
**Changes Made (Task 2 Fine-Tuning):**
- Merged Q03+Q04 into Q02 (service mesh latency by architecture + portable policies)
- Merged Section 3 (General Network Policies) and Section 5 (Kubernetes Policies) → Single Section 3 with 8 questions (Q010-Q017)
- Renumbered all questions: KSI-CNA-03-Q001 through KSI-CNA-03-Q030
- Tightened Q018-Q022 (formerly Q19-Q23) to emphasize policy-driven traffic *control* rather than performance metrics
- Updated Section 5 (mTLS) title to emphasize "Identity Binding to Traffic Flows"
- Enhanced Q023-Q025 with language about policy-driven unauthorized flow prevention
- Clarified Q029-Q030 to show AI/ML models as policy decision inputs, not standalone intelligence tools

**Questions Merged:** 2 questions (Q03+Q04 → Q002; old Q25 → Q010)
**Sections Consolidated:** 2 sections (General Network Policies + Kubernetes-specific)
**Final Question Count:** 30 (down from 40)
**Focus:** Policy-driven enforcement of traffic flows for AI agents, with emphasis on control mechanisms vs. performance optimization

**Research Basis:** 190 papers synthesized into 9 thematic clusters emphasizing: agent communication protocols (10 papers), AI-driven network intelligence (10 papers), Kubernetes network segmentation (20 papers), service mesh security (19 papers), edge-distributed AI (23 papers), programmable data planes (7 papers), traffic shaping for AI (5 papers), SDN threats (8 papers), zero-trust multi-tenancy (7 papers). Key findings validated: Istio Ambient 8% latency vs. 166% traditional sidecar, Agent-to-Agent Protocol production-ready, SPIFFE workload identity standard, carbon-aware routing enables 35% emission reduction.
