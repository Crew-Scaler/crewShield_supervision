   - Deploy automated compliance testing infrastructure
   - Implement disaster recovery testing framework
   - Establish incident response procedures
   - Configure monitoring and alerting

3. ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT (Priority: HIGH)
   - Train incident response teams
   - Conduct tabletop exercises (quarterly recommended)
   - Document and test recovery procedures
   - Establish governance structure per NIST CSF 2.0

4. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Monitor regulatory updates (especially NIS2 and DORA implementation details)
   - Adjust practices based on industry lessons learned (e.g., ECB stress test results)
   - Expand automation to reduce manual compliance burden
   - Conduct full disaster recovery test annually minimum
