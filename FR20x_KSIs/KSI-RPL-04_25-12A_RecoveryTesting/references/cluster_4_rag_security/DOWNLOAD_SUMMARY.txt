  - Memory persistence: 100% across agent episodes

Defense Performance:
  - Detection accuracy: 70-90% for statistical methods
  - Recovery time: Minutes to hours depending on scale
  - Performance overhead: 5-20% computational cost
  - Accuracy preservation: <2% loss with proper defenses

System Scale Impact:
  - Small KB (1K docs): <1 second detection
  - Medium KB (100K docs): 10-30 seconds
  - Large KB (1M+ docs): Minutes to hours (optimization needed)

================================================================================
RESEARCH GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Critical Gaps:
  1. Evaluation against production RAG systems limited
  2. Defense scalability to billions of documents unclear
  3. Multimodal attack/defense mechanisms underdeveloped
  4. Federated RAG security largely unexplored
  5. Adaptive attack resistance mechanisms needed

Recommendations:
  1. Implement layered detection (statistical + semantic)
  2. Use Byzantine-robust aggregation for federated systems
  3. Employ continuous monitoring of retriever behavior
  4. Implement automated recovery procedures
  5. Deploy zero-trust architectures in production
  6. Use checksums/fingerprints for document integrity
  7. Conduct regular poison detection audits
