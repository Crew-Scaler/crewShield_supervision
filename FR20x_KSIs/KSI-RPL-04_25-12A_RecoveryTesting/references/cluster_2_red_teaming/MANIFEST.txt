RECOVERY SYSTEM RELEVANCE
================================================================================

PRIMARY USE CASES:
  ✓ Threat modeling for recovery systems under attack
  ✓ Testing recovery robustness against adversarial inputs
  ✓ Designing detection mechanisms for attack-triggered recovery
  ✓ Evaluating recovery success rates under adversarial conditions
  ✓ Benchmarking recovery mechanisms against known attack vectors

KEY PAPERS FOR RECOVERY ENGINEERS:
  1. 2509.21947v2 - Adaptive attacks (testing under evolving threats)
  2. 2502.14847v2 - Multi-agent attacks (distributed recovery vulnerabilities)
  3. 2512.20986v1 - AegisAgent (autonomous recovery patterns)
  4. 2512.23128v1 - TRAP (recovery task validation)
  5. 2407.12784v1 - Memory poisoning (state integrity challenges)

ATTACK VECTORS FOR RECOVERY TESTING:
  ✓ Pre-recovery: False recovery triggers, cascade attacks
  ✓ During-recovery: Recovery poisoning, verification bypass
  ✓ Post-recovery: Residual state exploitation, adaptive attacks

CSP IMPLICATIONS:
  ✓ Multi-tenant recovery requires Byzantine-fault tolerance
  ✓ Distributed recovery verification critical
  ✓ Attack detection must precede recovery initiation
  ✓ Continuous recovery validation required
  ✓ Recovery SLAs must account for adversarial conditions
