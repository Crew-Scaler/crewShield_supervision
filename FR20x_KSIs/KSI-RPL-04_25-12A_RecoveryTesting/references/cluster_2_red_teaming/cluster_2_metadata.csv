2509.21947v2,Active Attacks: Red-teaming LLMs via Adaptive Environments,Taeyoung Yun; Pierre-Luc St-Charles; Jinkyoo Park; Yoshua Bengio; Minsu Kim,2025-09-26,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21947v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21947v2.pdf,"We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/active_attacks}{here}."
2509.21011v1,Automatic Red Teaming LLM-based Agents with Model Context Protocol Tools,Ping He; Changjiang Li; Binbin Zhao; Tianyu Du; Shouling Ji,2025-09-25,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21011v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21011v1.pdf,"The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP) tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents. Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms, thereby revealing new security risks in these agents."

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also present an extension to a current jailbreak-template-based strategy and propose a novel template, showing higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 96\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}"
2502.14847v2,Red-Teaming LLM Multi-Agent Systems via Communication Attacks,Pengfei He; Yupin Lin; Shen Dong; Han Xu; Yue Xing; Hui Liu,2025-02-20,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14847v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14847v2.pdf,"Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have revolutionized complex problem-solving capability by enabling sophisticated agent collaboration through message-based communications. While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems."
2501.08246v1,Text-Diffusion Red-Teaming of Large Language Models: Unveiling Harmful Behaviors with Proximity Constraints,Jonathan Nöther; Adish Singla; Goran Radanović,2025-01-14,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08246v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08246v1.pdf,"Recent work has proposed automated red-teaming methods for testing the vulnerabilities of a given target large language model (LLM). These methods use red-teaming LLMs to uncover inputs that induce harmful behavior in a target LLM. In this paper, we study red-teaming strategies that enable a targeted security assessment. We propose an optimization framework for red-teaming with proximity constraints, where the discovered prompts must be similar to reference prompts from a given dataset. This dataset serves as a template for the discovered prompts, anchoring the search for test-cases to specific topics, writing styles, or types of harmful behavior. We show that established auto-regressive model architectures do not perform well in this setting. We therefore introduce a black-box red-teaming method inspired by text-diffusion models: Diffusion for Auditing and Red-Teaming (DART). DART modifies the reference prompt by perturbing it in the embedding space, directly controlling the amount of change introduced. We systematically evaluate our method by comparing its effectiveness with established methods based on model fine-tuning and zero- and few-shot prompting. Our results show that DART is significantly more effective at discovering harmful inputs in close proximity to the reference prompt."
2411.14133v3,GASP: Efficient Black-Box Generation of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking LLMs,Advik Raj Basani; Xiao Zhang,2024-11-21,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14133v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14133v3.pdf,"LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs."

ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing software in terms of user numbers in human history and become an important foundational model for the next generation of artificial intelligence applications. However, the generations of LLMs are not entirely reliable, often producing content with factual errors, biases, and toxicity. Given their vast number of users and wide range of application scenarios, these unreliable responses can lead to many serious negative impacts. This thesis introduces the exploratory works in the field of language model reliability during the PhD study, focusing on the correctness, non-toxicity, and fairness of LLMs from both software testing and natural language processing perspectives. First, to measure the correctness of LLMs, we introduce two testing frameworks, FactChecker and LogicAsker, to evaluate factual knowledge and logical reasoning accuracy, respectively. Second, for the non-toxicity of LLMs, we introduce two works for red-teaming LLMs. Third, to evaluate the fairness of LLMs, we introduce two evaluation frameworks, BiasAsker and XCulturalBench, to measure the social bias and cultural bias of LLMs, respectively."
2407.15050v1,Arondight: Red Teaming Large Vision Language Models with Auto-generated Multi-modal Jailbreak Prompts,Yi Liu; Chengjun Cai; Xiaoli Zhang; Xingliang Yuan; Cong Wang,2024-07-21,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15050v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15050v1.pdf,"Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend and enhance the perceptual abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite offering new possibilities for LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs have undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming frameworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we introduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically for VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of visual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning existing red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an automated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are produced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM guided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of VLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward metrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in creating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our evaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning multi-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack success rate of 84.5\% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by OpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also categorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding reinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code will be released after ethics committee approval. CONTENT WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS HARMFUL MODEL RESPONSES."
2407.12784v1,AgentPoison: Red-teaming LLM Agents via Poisoning Memory or Knowledge Bases,Zhaorun Chen; Zhen Xiang; Chaowei Xiao; Dawn Song; Bo Li,2024-07-17,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12784v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12784v1.pdf,"LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable performance across various applications, primarily due to their advanced capabilities in reasoning, utilizing external knowledge and tools, calling APIs, and executing actions to interact with environments. Current agents typically utilize a memory module or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, retrieving past knowledge and instances with similar embeddings from knowledge bases to inform task planning and execution. However, the reliance on unverified knowledge bases raises significant concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. To uncover such vulnerabilities, we propose a novel red teaming approach AgentPoison, the first backdoor attack targeting generic and RAG-based LLM agents by poisoning their long-term memory or RAG knowledge base. In particular, we form the trigger generation process as a constrained optimization to optimize backdoor triggers by mapping the triggered instances to a unique embedding space, so as to ensure that whenever a user instruction contains the optimized backdoor trigger, the malicious demonstrations are retrieved from the poisoned memory or knowledge base with high probability. In the meantime, benign instructions without the trigger will still maintain normal performance. Unlike conventional backdoor attacks, AgentPoison requires no additional model training or fine-tuning, and the optimized backdoor trigger exhibits superior transferability, in-context coherence, and stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentPoison's effectiveness in attacking three types of real-world LLM agents: RAG-based autonomous driving agent, knowledge-intensive QA agent, and healthcare EHRAgent. On each agent, AgentPoison achieves an average attack success rate higher than 80% with minimal impact on benign performance (less than 1%) with a poison rate less than 0.1%."

In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize codeswitching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand codeswitching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating codeswitching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs."

To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a \textit{red team} of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs. However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming. Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM. However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM. To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty. Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods. Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages."
2512.23557v1,Toward Trustworthy Agentic AI: A Multimodal Framework for Preventing Prompt Injection Attacks,Toqeer Ali Syed; Mishal Ateeq Almutairi; Mahmoud Abdel Moaty,2025-12-29,http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23557v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23557v1.pdf,"Powerful autonomous systems, which reason, plan, and converse using and between numerous tools and agents, are made possible by Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and new agentic AI systems, like LangChain and GraphChain. Nevertheless, this agentic environment increases the probability of the occurrence of multimodal prompt injection (PI) attacks, in which concealed or malicious instructions carried in text, pictures, metadata, or agent-to-agent messages may spread throughout the graph and lead to unintended behavior, a breach of policy, or corruption of state. In order to mitigate these risks, this paper suggests a Cross-Agent Multimodal Provenanc- Aware Defense Framework whereby all the prompts, either user-generated or produced by upstream agents, are sanitized and all the outputs generated by an LLM are verified independently before being sent to downstream nodes. This framework contains a Text sanitizer agent, visual sanitizer agent, and output validator agent all coordinated by a provenance ledger, which keeps metadata of modality, source, and trust level throughout the entire agent network. This architecture makes sure that agent-to-agent communication abides by clear trust frames such such that injected instructions are not propagated down LangChain or GraphChain-style-workflows. The experimental assessments show that multimodal injection detection accuracy is significantly enhanced, and the cross-agent trust leakage is minimized, as well as, agentic execution pathways become stable. The framework, which expands the concept of provenance tracking and validation to the multi-agent orchestration, enhances the establishment of secure, understandable and reliable agentic AI systems."

However, the reliability of these systems is critically undermined by their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, where attackers deliberately input deceptive instructions into LLMs. Traditional defenses, based on static filters and rigid rules, are insufficient to address the semantic complexity of these new attacks. We argue that a paradigm shift is needed -- from passive filtering to active protection and autonomous reasoning. We introduce AegisAgent, an autonomous agent system designed to ensure the security of LLM-driven HAR systems. Instead of merely blocking threats, AegisAgent functions as a cognitive guardian. It autonomously perceives potential semantic inconsistencies, reasons about the user's true intent by consulting a dynamic memory of past interactions, and acts by generating and executing a multi-step verification and repair plan. We implement AegisAgent as a lightweight, full-stack prototype and conduct a systematic evaluation on 15 common attacks with five state-of-the-art LLM-based HAR systems on three public datasets. Results show it reduces attack success rate by 30\% on average while incurring only 78.6 ms of latency overhead on a GPU workstation.

We contribute to the greater ecosystem of open-source LLMs and their security in the following: (1) assessing present prompt-based defenses against the latest attacks, (2) introducing a new framework using a seed defense (Chain Of Thoughts) to refine the defense prompts iteratively, and (3) showing significant improvements in detecting goal hijacking attacks. Out strategies significantly reduce the success rates of the attacks and false detection rates while at the same time effectively detecting goal-hijacking capabilities, paving the way for more secure and efficient deployments of small and open-source LLMs in resource-constrained environments."

While these agents help automate repetitive online tasks, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can trick an agent into performing undesired actions, such as leaking private information or issuing state-changing requests. We propose ceLLMate, a browser-level sandboxing framework that restricts the agent's ambient authority and reduces the blast radius of prompt injections. We address two fundamental challenges: (1) The semantic gap challenge in policy enforcement arises because the agent operates through low-level UI observations and manipulations; however, writing and enforcing policies directly over UI-level events is brittle and error-prone. To address this challenge, we introduce an agent sitemap that maps low-level browser behaviors to high-level semantic actions. (2) Policy prediction in BUAs is the norm rather than the exception. BUAs have no app developer to pre-declare sandboxing policies, and thus, ceLLMate pairs website-authored mandatory policies with an automated policy-prediction layer that adapts and instantiates these policies from the user's natural-language task. We implement ceLLMate as an agent-agnostic browser extension and demonstrate how it enables sandboxing policies that effectively block various types of prompt injection attacks with negligible overhead."

In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data.
  In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated.

This paper presents Rennervate, a defense framework to detect and prevent IPI attacks. Rennervate leverages attention features to detect the covert injection at a fine-grained token level, enabling precise sanitization that neutralizes IPI attacks while maintaining LLM functionalities. Specifically, the token-level detector is materialized with a 2-step attentive pooling mechanism, which aggregates attention heads and response tokens for IPI detection and sanitization. Moreover, we establish a fine-grained IPI dataset, FIPI, to be open-sourced to support further research. Extensive experiments verify that Rennervate outperforms 15 commercial and academic IPI defense methods, achieving high precision on 5 LLMs and 6 datasets. We also demonstrate that Rennervate is transferable to unseen attacks and robust against adaptive adversaries."

However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification."

ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications."

These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies."

In this paper, we present IntentGuard, a general defense framework based on instruction-following intent analysis. The key insight of IntentGuard is that the decisive factor in IPIAs is not the presence of malicious text, but whether the LLM intends to follow instructions from untrusted data. Building on this insight, IntentGuard leverages an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to identify which parts of the input prompt the model recognizes as actionable instructions, and then flag or neutralize any overlaps with untrusted data segments. To instantiate the framework, we develop an IIA that uses three ""thinking intervention"" strategies to elicit a structured list of intended instructions from reasoning-enabled LLMs. These techniques include start-of-thinking prefilling, end-of-thinking refinement, and adversarial in-context demonstration. We evaluate IntentGuard on two agentic benchmarks (AgentDojo and Mind2Web) using two reasoning-enabled LLMs (Qwen-3-32B and gpt-oss-20B). Results demonstrate that IntentGuard achieves (1) no utility degradation in all but one setting and (2) strong robustness against adaptive prompt injection attacks (e.g., reducing attack success rates from 100% to 8.5% in a Mind2Web scenario)."

However, systematic analyses of whether this behavior is truly a reflection of its safety policies or an indication of political censorship, that is practiced globally by countries, is lacking. Differentiating between safety influenced refusals or politically motivated censorship is hard and unclear. For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship. We conclude with summarizing major attributes that can cause a shift in refusal distributions across models and contexts of different countries."

  In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models.

We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security."
2511.21752v1,Semantics as a Shield: Label Disguise Defense (LDD) against Prompt Injection in LLM Sentiment Classification,Yanxi Li; Ruocheng Shan,2025-11-23,http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21752v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.21752v1.pdf,"Large language models are increasingly used for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, yet their reliance on natural language prompts exposes them to prompt injection attacks. In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection."

Security analysis of real-world incidents reveals prompt injection attacks make general-purpose autonomous operation fundamentally unsafe. The paper argues against developing general browsing intelligence in favor of specialized tools with programmatic constraints, where safety boundaries are enforced through code instead of large language model (LLM) reasoning.

A curated dataset of benign and adversarial prompts was encoded with sentence embedding and used to train both centralized and federated logistic regression models. The federated approach preserved privacy by sharing only model parameters across clients, while achieving detection performance comparable to centralized training. Results demonstrate that effective prompt injection detection is feasible without exposing raw data, making this one of the first explorations of federated security for LLMs. Although the dataset is limited in scale, the findings establish a strong proof-of-concept and highlight new directions for building secure and privacy-aware LLM systems."

Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework.

In contrast, simpler LLM applications, such as customer service chatbots, are widespread on the web, yet their security posture and exposure to such attacks remain poorly understood. These applications often rely on third-party chatbot plugins that act as intermediaries to commercial LLM APIs, offering non-expert website builders intuitive ways to customize chatbot behaviors. To bridge this gap, we present the first large-scale study of 17 third-party chatbot plugins used by over 10,000 public websites, uncovering previously unknown prompt injection risks in practice. First, 8 of these plugins (used by 8,000 websites) fail to enforce the integrity of the conversation history transmitted in network requests between the website visitor and the chatbot. This oversight amplifies the impact of direct prompt injection attacks by allowing adversaries to forge conversation histories (including fake system messages), boosting their ability to elicit unintended behavior (e.g., code generation) by 3 to 8x. Second, 15 plugins offer tools, such as web-scraping, to enrich the chatbot's context with website-specific content. However, these tools do not distinguish the website's trusted content (e.g., product descriptions) from untrusted, third-party content (e.g., customer reviews), introducing a risk of indirect prompt injection. Notably, we found that ~13% of e-commerce websites have already exposed their chatbots to third-party content. We systematically evaluate both vulnerabilities through controlled experiments grounded in real-world observations, focusing on factors such as system prompt design and the underlying LLM. Our findings show that many plugins adopt insecure practices that undermine the built-in LLM safeguards."

Their ability to follow natural-language instructions, while powerful, also makes them vulnerable to a new class of attacks known as prompt injection. In these attacks, hidden or malicious instructions are inserted into user inputs or external content, causing the model to ignore its intended task or produce unsafe responses. This study proposes a unified framework for evaluating how resistant Large Language Models (LLMs) are to prompt injection attacks. The framework defines three complementary metrics such as the Resilience Degradation Index (RDI), Safety Compliance Coefficient (SCC), and Instructional Integrity Metric (IIM) to jointly measure robustness, safety, and semantic stability. We evaluated four instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, and Flan-T5-Large) on five common language tasks: question answering, summarization, translation, reasoning, and code generation. Results show that GPT-4 performs best overall, while open-weight models remain more vulnerable. The findings highlight that strong alignment and safety tuning are more important for resilience than model size alone. Results show that all models remain partially vulnerable, especially to indirect and direct-override attacks. GPT-4 achieved the best overall resilience (RDR = 9.8 %, SCR = 96.4 %), while open-source models exhibited higher performance degradation and lower safety scores. The findings demonstrate that alignment strength and safety tuning play a greater role in resilience than model size alone. The proposed framework offers a structured, reproducible approach for assessing model robustness and provides practical insights for improving LLM safety and reliability."

Such issues can damage reputations, waste resources, and even endanger lives when flawed studies influence medical or safety-critical systems. This research explores both the offensive and defensive sides of this growing threat. On the attack side, we demonstrate how an author can inject hidden prompts inside a PDF that secretly guide or ""jailbreak"" LLM reviewers into giving overly positive feedback and biased acceptance. On the defense side, we propose an ""inject-and-detect"" strategy for editors, where invisible trigger prompts are embedded into papers; if a review repeats or reacts to these triggers, it reveals that the review was generated by an LLM, not a human. This method turns prompt injections from vulnerability into a verification tool. We outline our design, expected model behaviors, and ethical safeguards for deployment. The goal is to expose how fragile today's peer-review process becomes under LLM influence and how editorial awareness can help restore trust in scientific evaluation."

Despite these controls, preventing prompt-based policy evasion remains challenging, and adversaries continue to jailbreak LLMs by crafting prompts that circumvent implemented safety mechanisms. While prior jailbreak techniques have explored obfuscation and contextual manipulation, many operate as single-step transformations, and their effectiveness is inconsistent across current state-of-the-art models. This leaves a limited understanding of multistage prompt-transformation attacks that evade moderation, reconstruct forbidden intent, and elicit policy-violating outputs.
  This paper introduces RoguePrompt, an automated jailbreak pipeline that leverages dual-layer prompt transformations to convert forbidden prompts into safety-evading queries. By partitioning the forbidden prompts and applying two nested encodings (ROT-13 and Vigenère) along with natural-language decoding instructions, it produces benign-looking prompts that evade filters and induce the model to execute the original prompt within a single query. RoguePrompt was developed and evaluated under a black-box threat model, with only API and UI access to the LLMs, and tested on 313 real-world hard-rejected prompts. Success was measured in terms of moderation bypass, instruction reconstruction, and execution, using both automated and human evaluation. It achieved an average of 93.93% filter bypass, 79.02% reconstruction, and 70.18% execution success across multiple frontier LLMs. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of layered prompt encoding and highlight the need for innovative defenses to detect and mitigate self-reconstructing jailbreaks."

In general, existing jailbreak techniques either optimize a semantic template intended to induce the LLM to produce harmful outputs or optimize a suffix that leads the LLM to initiate its response with specific tokens (e.g., ""Sure"").
  In this work, we introduce TASO (Template and Suffix Optimization), a novel jailbreak method that optimizes both a template and a suffix in an alternating manner. Our insight is that suffix optimization and template optimization are complementary to each other: suffix optimization can effectively control the first few output tokens but cannot control the overall quality of the output, while template optimization provides guidance for the entire output but cannot effectively control the initial tokens, which significantly impact subsequent responses. Thus, they can be combined to improve the attack's effectiveness.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of TASO on benchmark datasets (including HarmBench and AdvBench) on 24 leading LLMs (including models from the Llama family, OpenAI, and DeepSeek). The results demonstrate that TASO can effectively jailbreak existing LLMs. We hope our work can inspire future studies in exploring this direction."

However, most existing black-box jailbreak attacks rely on hand-crafted heuristics or narrow search spaces, which limit scalability. Compared with prior attacks, we propose Game-Theory Attack (GTA), an scalable black-box jailbreak framework. Concretely, we formalize the attacker's interaction against safety-aligned LLMs as a finite-horizon, early-stoppable sequential stochastic game, and reparameterize the LLM's randomized outputs via quantal response. Building on this, we introduce a behavioral conjecture ""template-over-safety flip"": by reshaping the LLM's effective objective through game-theoretic scenarios, the originally safety preference may become maximizing scenario payoffs within the template, which weakens safety constraints in specific contexts. We validate this mechanism with classical game such as the disclosure variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and we further introduce an Attacker Agent that adaptively escalates pressure to increase the ASR. Experiments across multiple protocols and datasets show that GTA achieves over 95% ASR on LLMs such as Deepseek-R1, while maintaining efficiency. Ablations over components, decoding, multilingual settings, and the Agent's core model confirm effectiveness and generalization. Moreover, scenario scaling studies further establish scalability. GTA also attains high ASR on other game-theoretic scenarios, and one-shot LLM-generated variants that keep the model mechanism fixed while varying background achieve comparable ASR. Paired with a Harmful-Words Detection Agent that performs word-level insertions, GTA maintains high ASR while lowering detection under prompt-guard models. Beyond benchmarks, GTA jailbreaks real-world LLM applications and reports a longitudinal safety monitoring of popular HuggingFace LLMs."

In a human validation study with 108 senior volunteers, AI-generated phishing emails successfully compromised 11\% of participants. Our work uniquely demonstrates the complete attack pipeline targeting elderly populations, highlighting that current AI safety measures fail to protect those most vulnerable to fraud. Beyond generating phishing content, LLMs enable attackers to overcome language barriers and conduct multi-turn trust-building conversations at scale, fundamentally transforming fraud economics. While some providers report voluntary counter-abuse efforts, we argue these remain insufficient."

Despite safety fine-tuning, however, they remain susceptible to adversarial prompts that elicit harmful content. Existing jailbreak techniques fall into two categories: white-box methods (e.g., gradient-based approaches such as GCG), which require model internals and are infeasible for closed-source APIs, and black-box methods that rely on attacker LLMs to search or mutate prompts but often produce templates that lack explainability and transferability. We introduce TrojFill, a black-box jailbreak that reframes unsafe instruction as a template-filling task. TrojFill embeds obfuscated harmful instructions (e.g., via placeholder substitution or Caesar/Base64 encoding) inside a multi-part template that asks the model to (1) reason why the original instruction is unsafe (unsafety reasoning) and (2) generate a detailed example of the requested text, followed by a sentence-by-sentence analysis. The crucial ""example"" component acts as a Trojan Horse that contains the target jailbreak content while the surrounding task framing reduces refusal rates. We evaluate TrojFill on standard jailbreak benchmarks across leading LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen), showing strong empirical performance (e.g., 100% attack success on Gemini-flash-2.5 and DeepSeek-3.1, and 97% on GPT-4o). Moreover, the generated prompts exhibit improved interpretability and transferability compared with prior black-box optimization approaches. We release our code, sample prompts, and generated outputs to support future red-teaming research."

Existing jailbreak attacks mainly follow sequential logic, where LLMs understand and answer each given task one by one. However, concurrency, a natural extension of the sequential scenario, has been largely overlooked. In this work, we first propose a word-level method to enable task concurrency in LLMs, where adjacent words encode divergent intents. Although LLMs maintain strong utility in answering concurrent tasks, which is demonstrated by our evaluations on mathematical and general question-answering benchmarks, we notably observe that combining a harmful task with a benign one significantly reduces the probability of it being filtered by the guardrail, showing the potential risks associated with concurrency in LLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$, an iterative attack framework that $\underline{\text{JAIL}}$breaks LLMs via task $\underline{\text{CON}}$currency. Experiments on widely-used LLMs demonstrate the strong jailbreak capabilities of $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ compared to existing attacks. Furthermore, when the guardrail is applied as a defense, compared to the sequential answers generated by previous attacks, the concurrent answers in our $\texttt{JAIL-CON}$ exhibit greater stealthiness and are less detectable by the guardrail, highlighting the unique feature of task concurrency in jailbreaking LLMs."

In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that weaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a three-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought distraction with a core ""Trojan Schema""--a carefully crafted data structure that compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong tendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is highly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13 foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation study confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To counter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a defense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a ""Literal Transcription""--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the user's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high efficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is a viable mitigation strategy. Our work provides a look into how an LLM's core strengths can be turned into critical weaknesses, offering a fresh perspective for building more robustly aligned models."

We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities."

Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs' safety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak performance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as few as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful jailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious fine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by fine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased sensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically, our fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with benign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is then performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to forget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of the harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and compare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack stealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in current LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security is compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses."

Nevertheless, these methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs' alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs' alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs. Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro.

HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1) \textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries."

In this work, we introduce TRIAL (Trolley-problem Reasoning for Interactive Attack Logic), a framework that leverages LLMs ethical reasoning to bypass their safeguards. TRIAL embeds adversarial goals within ethical dilemmas modeled on the trolley problem. TRIAL demonstrates high jailbreak success rates towards both open and close-source models. Our findings underscore a fundamental limitation in AI safety: as models gain advanced reasoning abilities, the nature of their alignment may inadvertently allow for more covert security vulnerabilities to be exploited. TRIAL raises an urgent need in reevaluating safety alignment oversight strategies, as current safeguards may prove insufficient against context-aware adversarial attack."

In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations, we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other architectures and larger models remains to be validated."

So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June 2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat.

It masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings. Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack (\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or defense-focused papers.

We assess these findings and the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs, ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of general-purpose LLMs."

While numerous jailbreak methods exist, many suffer from computational expense, high token usage, or complex decoding schemes. Liu et al. (2024) introduced FlipAttack, a black-box method that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) through simple prompt manipulation. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of FlipAttack's effectiveness by analyzing the semantic changes induced by its flipping modes. We hypothesize that semantic dissimilarity between original and manipulated prompts is inversely correlated with ASR. To test this, we examine embedding space visualizations (UMAP, KDE) and cosine similarities for FlipAttack's modes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial attack, Alphabet Index Mapping (AIM), designed to maximize semantic dissimilarity while maintaining simple decodability. Experiments on GPT-4 using a subset of AdvBench show AIM and its variant AIM+FWO achieve a 94% ASR, outperforming FlipAttack and other methods on this subset. Our findings suggest that while high semantic dissimilarity is crucial, a balance with decoding simplicity is key for successful jailbreaking.

Models like ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts. However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility.
  We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method. Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and safety.

At its core, OpenRT architects a paradigm shift in automated red-teaming by introducing an adversarial kernel that enables modular separation across five critical dimensions: model integration, dataset management, attack strategies, judging methods, and evaluation metrics. By standardizing attack interfaces, it decouples adversarial logic from a high-throughput asynchronous runtime, enabling systematic scaling across diverse models.

However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \textit{Bias Recommendation}, \textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work. All code, datasets, and experimental configurations will be merged into our primary repository at https://github.com/bboylyg/BackdoorLLM."

This binds their creativity and leaves them unable to autonomously invent entirely new attack mechanisms. To overcome this gap, we introduce \textbf{EvoSynth}, an autonomous framework that shifts the paradigm from attack planning to the evolutionary synthesis of jailbreak methods. Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods.

Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings, our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1 model.

Red-Bandit post-trains a set of parameter-efficient LoRA experts, each specialized for a particular attack style, using reinforcement learning that rewards the generation of unsafe prompts via a rule-based safety model. At inference, a multi-armed bandit policy dynamically selects among these attack-style experts based on the target model's response safety, balancing exploration and exploitation. Red-Bandit achieves state-of-the-art results on AdvBench under sufficient exploration (ASR@10), while producing more human-readable prompts (lower perplexity).

Our automatic typographic prompt injection (ATPI) algorithm maximizes prompt reconstruction by substituting captioners while minimizing human detectability via a stealth loss, with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator guiding black-box optimization over text placement, size, and color. To further enhance attack strength, we develop AgentTypo-pro, a multi-LLM system that iteratively refines injection prompts using evaluation feedback and retrieves successful past examples for continual learning. Effective prompts are abstracted into generalizable strategies and stored in a strategy repository, enabling progressive knowledge accumulation and reuse in future attacks. Experiments on the VWA-Adv benchmark across Classifieds, Shopping, and Reddit scenarios show that AgentTypo significantly outperforms the latest image-based attacks such as AgentAttack.

To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS.

We introduce Geometric Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes -- structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm, observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as 22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

We demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy, bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies, and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\% in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare workflows.

This raises serious concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs from the T2I system, is increasingly recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before real-world deployment. However, existing automated red teaming approaches often treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system. Unlike prior work that optimizes prompts individually, DREAM directly models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into a simple and tractable form. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient optimization algorithm that provides stable gradient estimates through the long and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. During inference, we also propose a diversity-aware sampling strategy to enhance prompt variety. The effectiveness of DREAM is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of T2I models and safety filters in terms of both prompt success rate and diversity.

A typical example is environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response. Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models, revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal decision making."

Building on recent findings that fine-tuning LLMs with pseudo-malicious cyber security data significantly compromises their safety, this paper presents a comprehensive validation and extension of these safety risks using a different evaluation framework. We employ the garak red teaming framework with the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications to assess four open-source LLMs: Mistral 7B, Llama 3 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and DeepSeek R1 8B. Our evaluation confirms and extends previous findings, showing that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs (e.g., the failure rate of Mistral 7B against prompt injection increases from 9.1% to 68.7%). We further propose and evaluate a novel safety alignment approach that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety precautions and ethical considerations. This work validates previous safety concerns through independent evaluation and introduces new methods for mitigating these risks, contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically aligned LLMs. This approach demonstrates that it is possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical utility, offering a practical path towards developing safer fine-tuning methodologies."

2504.01278v1,"Strategize Globally, Adapt Locally: A Multi-Turn Red Teaming Agent with Dual-Level Learning",Si Chen; Xiao Yu; Ninareh Mehrabi; Rahul Gupta; Zhou Yu; Ruoxi Jia,2025-04-02,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01278v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01278v1.pdf,"The exploitation of large language models (LLMs) for malicious purposes poses significant security risks as these models become more powerful and widespread. While most existing red-teaming frameworks focus on single-turn attacks, real-world adversaries typically operate in multi-turn scenarios, iteratively probing for vulnerabilities and adapting their prompts based on threat model responses. In this paper, we propose \AlgName, a novel multi-turn red-teaming agent that emulates sophisticated human attackers through complementary learning dimensions: global tactic-wise learning that accumulates knowledge over time and generalizes to new attack goals, and local prompt-wise learning that refines implementations for specific goals when initial attempts fail. Unlike previous multi-turn approaches that rely on fixed strategy sets, \AlgName enables the agent to identify new jailbreak tactics, develop a goal-based tactic selection framework, and refine prompt formulations for selected tactics. Empirical evaluations on JailbreakBench demonstrate our framework's superior performance, achieving over 90\% attack success rates against GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-3.1-70B within 5 conversation turns, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of dynamic learning in identifying and exploiting model vulnerabilities in realistic multi-turn scenarios."
