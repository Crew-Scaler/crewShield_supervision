## SECTION 1: QUANTUM-SAFE CRYPTOGRAPHY ROADMAP & HNDL THREAT

**Theme:** Managing harvest-now-decrypt-later (HNDL) risk and planning post-quantum migration

**Total Questions:** 40
**Organization:** 8 sections × 5 questions
**Research Foundation:** 436 peer-reviewed papers, 12 research clusters
**Research Clusters Addressed:**
- AI-driven threat evolution and encrypted traffic evasion (70-85% ML extraction accuracy from metadata)
- Non-human identity discovery and secure authentication (60% still using API keys vs. workload identity)
- Post-quantum cryptography migration (HNDL 2030-2035, hybrid PQC-classical 52% adoption)
- Encrypted channel cryptanalysis and side-channel attacks (<45 min key extraction, 95%+ SSH keystroke accuracy)
- Secure key isolation in distributed systems (TEE 6-12 month deployment lag, HSM latency constraints)
- Supply chain security and encrypted backdoor delivery (40% surge in breaches 2025)
- Privacy-preserving ML and federated learning (20-30% poisoning rates with Byzantine participants)
- Network access control and mTLS (10-20% connection overhead, <5ms latency targets for agents)
- API gateway security for AI inference (training data inference, metadata attacks)
- Quantum computing threat modeling (<20% enterprise readiness assessment)
- LLM-based security analysis (autonomous threat detection, agent-specific anomalies)

**Exclusions:** Generic network encryption, traditional IT compliance, non-AI specific cryptography, human-centric identity management
