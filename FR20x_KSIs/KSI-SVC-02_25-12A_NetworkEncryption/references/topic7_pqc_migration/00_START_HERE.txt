KEY METRICS YOU NEED TO KNOW
================================================================================

Handshake Latency Increase:
  ✓ With optimization:        10-15% (achievable)
  ✓ Without optimization:     20-30%
  ✓ Best measured:            0.15 ms (optimized server)
  ✓ Typical range:            0.41-4.8 ms

Certificate Size Growth:
  ✗ Classical ECDSA:          64 bytes
  ✓ ML-DSA signature:         2544 bytes (40x larger!)
  ✗ Classical X25519:         32 bytes
  ✓ ML-KEM public key:        1184 bytes (37x larger!)
  RESULT: Total growth = 2-4x in typical TLS handshakes

Performance Optimization Results:

  ✓ Batch key generation:     3.5-4.9x faster
  ✓ HQC optimization:         55% speedup
  ✓ QUIC packet protection:   10-20% overhead

Algorithm Recommendations:
  ✓ TLS/HTTPS:                ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 (NIST standard)
  ✓ 5G/Mobile:                ML-KEM + ML-DSA (best for latency)

  ✓ QUIC:                     Kyber + Dilithium (low handshake impact)
  ✓ IoT/Embedded:             ML-KEM + Falcon (balanced resources)

Security Threats:
  ⚠ Fingerprinting attacks:   98-100% detection accuracy
  ⚠ Algorithm identification: 86-97% accuracy

CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

Finding #1: HANDSHAKE LATENCY IS ACCEPTABLE
  - Measured: 10-15% increase with optimization
  - Can be reduced further with AVX-512 (1.64x faster)
  - ML-KEM is best choice for TLS (NIST finalized Aug 2024)

Finding #2: CERTIFICATE SIZE IS A REAL CHALLENGE
  - Signatures: 40x larger (ECDSA 64B → ML-DSA 2544B)
  - Public keys: 37x larger (X25519 32B → ML-KEM 1184B)
  - Impact: DNS fragmentation, larger storage, increased bandwidth

Finding #3: ALGORITHM CHOICE MATTERS
  - SPHINCS+ has very high overhead (avoid unless necessary)
  - ML-KEM + ML-DSA provides best all-around balance
  - Falcon good for signature-critical scenarios

Finding #4: HYBRID APPROACH IS RECOMMENDED
  - Keep classical algorithms (forward secrecy)
  - Add PQC alongside (quantum safety)
  - Backward compatible via TLS ciphersuites

Finding #5: SECURITY THREATS ARE REAL
  - Fingerprinting attacks: 98-100% accurate
  - Requires constant-time implementation
  - Side-channel resistance needed (masking-friendly designs)
