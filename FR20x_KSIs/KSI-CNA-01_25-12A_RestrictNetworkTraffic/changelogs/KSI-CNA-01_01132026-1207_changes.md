**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets

**Filtering Criteria Applied (Issue #18 Review):**
- Retained: All questions directly assessing network traffic restriction for AI systems (Q01-Q41)
- Removed: Q42-Q43 (regulatory compliance and audit findings; moved to compliance/governance KSI scope)
- Marked Optional: Q34 (hard isolation tech and performance trade-off; overlaps with workload isolation/platform engineering KSI)
- Original criteria: Removed generic network procedures, vendor selection, and non-AI-specific controls not addressing AI agent isolation, multi-tenant boundaries, or AI-era egress threats (semantic exfiltration, autonomous weaponization)

**Final Question Count:** 41 core questions (Q01-Q41, with Q34 marked optional for reference) + 2 questions deferred to other KSIs (original Q42-Q43)

**Research Basis:** 288 papers synthesized into 9 thematic clusters emphasizing: zero-trust architecture (41 papers, 313MB), AI agents as threats (34 papers, 73MB), data exfiltration & AI-DLP (50 papers, 127MB), container escape (32 papers, 64MB), behavioral anomaly detection (111 papers, 284MB). Quantitative thresholds validated: 70-85% attack path reduction (zero-trust), 60-70% attack surface reduction (microsegmentation), 94.4% agent vulnerability rate without per-agent policies, 90-99% DLP detection accuracy.
