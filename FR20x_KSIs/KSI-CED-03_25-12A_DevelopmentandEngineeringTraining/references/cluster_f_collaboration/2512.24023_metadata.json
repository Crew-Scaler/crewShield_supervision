  "summary": "Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refo"
