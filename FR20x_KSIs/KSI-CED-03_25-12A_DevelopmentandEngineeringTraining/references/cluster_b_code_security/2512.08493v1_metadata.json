  "summary": "Vulnerability code-bases often suffer from severe imbalance, limiting the effectiveness of Deep Learning-based vulnerability classifiers. Data Augmentation could help solve this by mitigating the scarcity of under-represented CWEs. In this context, we investigate LLM-based augmentation for vulnerable functions, comparing controlled generation of new vulnerable samples with semantics-preserving refactoring of existing ones. Using Qwen2.5-Coder to produce augmented data and CodeBERT as a vulnerabi"
