  "summary": "In todays security landscape, every user wants to access large amounts of data with confidentiality and authorization. To maintain confidentiality, various researchers have proposed several techniques. However, to access secure data, researchers use access control lists to grant authentication and provide authorization. The above several steps will increase the server's computation overhead and response time. To cope with these two problems, we proposed multiparty execution on the server. In thi"
