  "summary": "We investigate when a maximum distance separable ($MDS$) code over $F_q$ is also completely regular ($CR$). For lengths $n=q+1$ and $n=q+2$ we provide a complete classification of the $MDS$ codes that are $CR$ or at least uniformly packed in the wide sense ($UPWS$). For the more restricted case $n\\leq q$ with $q\\leq 5$ we obtain a full classification (up to equivalence) of all nontrivial $MDS$ codes: there are none for $q=2$; only the ternary Hamming code for $q=3$; four nontrivial families for "
