  "summary": "This paper develops a discrete theory of real Riemann surfaces based on quadrilateral cellular decompositions (quad-graphs) and a linear discretization of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We construct a discrete analogue of an antiholomorphic involution and classify the topological types of discrete real Riemann surfaces, recovering the classical results on the number of real ovals and the separation of the surface.\n  Central to our approach is the construction of a symplectic homology basis adapte"
