  "summary": "We develop a composite operational architecture for sequential quantum measurements that (i) gives a tight bipartite order-effect bound with an explicit equality set characterized on the Halmos two-subspace block, (ii) upgrades Doeblin-type minorization to composite instruments and proves a product lower bound for the operational Doeblin constants, yielding data-driven exponential mixing rates, (iii) derives a diamond-norm commutator bound that quantifies how serial and parallel rearrangements i"
