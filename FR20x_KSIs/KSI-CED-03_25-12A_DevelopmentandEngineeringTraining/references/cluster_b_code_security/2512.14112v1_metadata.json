  "summary": "Supply chain management (SCM) faces significant challenges like demand fluctuations and the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods and even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with benchmarks like the Vending Machine Test, failing to handle SCM's complex continuous time-series data. While ML approaches like LSTM and XGBoost offer solutions, they are often limited by computational inefficiency. Liquid Neural Networks (LNN), known for their adaptability and efficiency in robotics, remain untapped in SCM."
