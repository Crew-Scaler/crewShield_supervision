  "summary": "We study the question of the least number of random edges that need to be added to a P\u00f3sa-Seymour graph, that is, a graph with minimum degree exceeding $\\frac k{k+1}n$, to secure the existence of the $m$-th power of a Hamiltonian cycle, $m&gt;k$. It turns out that, depending on $k$ and $m$, this quantity may be captured by two types of thresholds, with one of them, called over-threshold, becoming dominant for large $m$. Indeed, for each $k\\ge2$ and $m&gt;m_0(k)$, we establish asymptotically tigh"
