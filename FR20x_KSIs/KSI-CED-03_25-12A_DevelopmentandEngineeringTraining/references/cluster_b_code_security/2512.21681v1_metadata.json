  "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is increasingly adopted to enhance Large Language Models for software development, yet its security implications remain dangerously underexplored. This paper conducts the first systematic exploration of a critical and stealthy threat: backdoor attacks targeting the retriever component, which represents a significant supply-chain vulnerability. It is infeasible to assess this threat realistically, as existing attack methods are either too ineffective to "
