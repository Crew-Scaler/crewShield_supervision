  "summary": "The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a critical tool for securing the software supply chain (SSC), but its practical utility is undermined by inaccuracies in both its generation and its application in vulnerability scanning. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study on 2,414 open-source repositories to address these issues from a practical standpoint. First, we demonstrate that using lock files with strong package managers enables the generation of accurate and consistent SBOMs, esta"
