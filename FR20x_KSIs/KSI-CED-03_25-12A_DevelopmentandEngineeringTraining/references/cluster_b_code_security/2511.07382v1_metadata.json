  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the automated generation of code from natural language prompts. However, low-resource languages (LRLs) like Bangla remain underrepresented due to the limited availability of instruction-to-code datasets and evaluation benchmarks. To address this, the BLP Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 introduced a shared task on \"Code Generation in Bangla\". In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative "
