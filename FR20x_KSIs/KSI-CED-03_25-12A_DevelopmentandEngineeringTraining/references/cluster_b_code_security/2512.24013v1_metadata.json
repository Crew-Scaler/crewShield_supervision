  "summary": "Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the Hi"
