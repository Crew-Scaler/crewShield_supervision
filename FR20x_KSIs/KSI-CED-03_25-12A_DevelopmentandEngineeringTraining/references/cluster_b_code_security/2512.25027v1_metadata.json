  "summary": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approx"
