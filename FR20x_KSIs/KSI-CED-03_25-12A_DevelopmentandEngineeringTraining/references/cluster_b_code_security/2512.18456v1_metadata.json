  "summary": "AI-for-Code (AI4Code) systems are reshaping software engineering, with tools like GitHub Copilot accelerating code generation, translation, and vulnerability detection. Alongside these advances, however, security risks remain pervasive: insecure outputs, biased benchmarks, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation undermine their reliability. This SoK surveys the landscape of AI4Code security across three core applications, identifying recurring gaps: benchmark dominance by Python and toy p"
