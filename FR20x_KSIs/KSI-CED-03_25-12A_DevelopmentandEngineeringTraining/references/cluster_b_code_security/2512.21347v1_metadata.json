  "summary": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping software engineering by profoundly influencing coding, documentation, and system maintenance practices. As these tools become deeply embedded in developers' daily workflows, understanding how they are used has become essential. This paper reports an empirical study of LLM adoption in software engineering, based on a survey of 46 industry professionals with diverse educational backgrounds and levels of experience. The results reve"
