  "summary": "Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creat"
