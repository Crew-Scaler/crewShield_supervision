  "summary": "In modern software ecosystems, 1-day vulnerabilities pose significant security risks due to extensive code reuse. Identifying vulnerable functions in target binaries alone is insufficient; it is also crucial to determine whether these functions have been patched. Existing methods, however, suffer from limited usability and accuracy. They often depend on the compilation process to extract features, requiring substantial manual effort and failing for certain software. Moreover, they cannot reliabl"
