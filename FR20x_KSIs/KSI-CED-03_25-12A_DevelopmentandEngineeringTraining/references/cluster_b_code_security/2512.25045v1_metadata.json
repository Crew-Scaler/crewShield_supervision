  "summary": "Many regularization priors for Bayesian regression assume the regression coefficients are a priori independent. In particular this is the case for standard Bayesian treatments of the lasso and the elastic net. While independence may be reasonable in some data-analytic settings, incorporating dependence in these prior distributions provides greater modeling flexibility. This paper introduces the orthant normal distribution in its general form and shows how it can be used to structure prior depend"
