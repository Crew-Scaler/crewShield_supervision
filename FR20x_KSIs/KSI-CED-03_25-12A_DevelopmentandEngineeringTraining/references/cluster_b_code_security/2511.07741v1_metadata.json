  "summary": "It is known that deep neural networks may exhibit dangerous behaviors under various security threats (e.g., backdoor attacks, adversarial attacks and safety property violation) and there exists an ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders. In this work, we propose a complementary perspective to utilize recent progress on \"neural network repair\" to mitigate these security threats and repair various kinds of neural network defects (arising from different security threats) within a unified "
