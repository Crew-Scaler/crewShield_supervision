  "summary": "Patch backporting, the process of migrating mainline security patches to older branches, is an essential task in maintaining popular open-source projects (e.g., Linux kernel). However, manual backporting can be labor-intensive, while existing automated methods, which heavily rely on predefined syntax or semantic rules, often lack agility for complex patches.\n  In this paper, we introduce PORTGPT, an LLM-agent for end-to-end automation of patch backporting in real-world scenarios.
