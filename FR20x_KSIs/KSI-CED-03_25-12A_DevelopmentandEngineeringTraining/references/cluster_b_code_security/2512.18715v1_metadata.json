  "summary": "Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficient and robust information transmission. However, its intrinsic characteristics also pose new security challenges, notably an increased vulnerability to eavesdropping attacks. Existing studies on defending against eavesdropping attacks in DeepJSCC, while demonstrating certain effectiveness, often incur considerable computational overhead or introduce performance trade-offs that may adversely affect legitima"
