  "summary": "MDS codes play a central role in practice due to their broad applications. To date, most known MDS codes are generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes, leaving codes that are not equivalent to GRS codes comparatively less understood. Studying this non-GRS regime is therefore of intrinsic theoretical interest, and is also practically relevant since the strong algebraic structure of GRS codes can be undesirable in cryptographic settings. Among the known non-GRS codes, twisted generalized Reed-Solomon ("
