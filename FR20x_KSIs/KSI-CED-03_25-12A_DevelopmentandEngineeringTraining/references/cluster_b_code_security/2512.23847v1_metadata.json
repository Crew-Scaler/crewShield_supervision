  "summary": "We develop a statistical test to detect lookahead bias in economic forecasts generated by large language models (LLMs). Using state-of-the-art pre-training data detection techniques, we estimate the likelihood that a given prompt appeared in an LLM's training corpus, a statistic we term Lookahead Propensity (LAP). We formally show that a positive correlation between LAP and forecast accuracy indicates the presence and magnitude of lookahead bias, and apply the test to two forecasting tasks: news"
