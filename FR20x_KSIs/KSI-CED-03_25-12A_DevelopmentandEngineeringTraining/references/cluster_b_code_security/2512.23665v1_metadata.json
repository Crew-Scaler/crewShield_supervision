  "summary": "Much algorithmic research in NLP aims to efficiently manipulate rich formal structures. An algorithm designer typically seeks to provide guarantees about their proposed algorithm -- for example, that its running time or space complexity is upper-bounded as a certain function of its input size. They may also wish to determine the necessary properties of the quantities derived by the algorithm to synthesize efficient data structures and verify type errors. In this paper, we develop a system for he"
