  "summary": "The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST), i.e., spatial gene expressions, has made it possible to measure gene expression within original tissue, enabling us to discover molecular mechanisms. However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a chall"
