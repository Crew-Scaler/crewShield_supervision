  "summary": "Embodied AI systems integrate language models with real world sensing, mobility, and cloud connected mobile apps. Yet while model jailbreaks have drawn significant attention, the broader system stack of embodied intelligence remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first holistic security analysis of the Unitree Go2 platform and uncover ten cross layer vulnerabilities the \"Ten Sins of Embodied AI Security.\" Using BLE sniffing, traffic interception, APK reverse engineering, cloud "
