  "summary": "Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL), where a small number of malicious clients can upload poisoned updates to compromise the federated global model. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories, passive and proactive, depending on whether the server proactively intervenes in the training process. However, both of them have inherent limitations in practice: passive detection methods are disrupted by common n"
