  "summary": "This article provides a comprehensive review of the critical role of detection efficiency in demonstrating non-classicality across various device-independent and semi-device-independent scenarios. The central focus is the detection loophole, a challenge in which imperfect detectors can allow classical hidden variable models to mimic quantum correlations, thus masking genuine non-classicality. As a review, the article revisits the paradigmatic Bell scenario, detailing the efficiency requirements "
