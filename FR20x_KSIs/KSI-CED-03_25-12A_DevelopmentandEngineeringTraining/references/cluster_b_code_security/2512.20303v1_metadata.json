  "summary": "The classical two-capacitor paradox of the lost energy is revisited from an electronic circuit security stand-point. The paradox has been solved previously by various researchers, and the energy lost during the charging of capacitors has been primarily attributed to the heat and radiation. We analytically prove this for various standard resistor-capacitor (RC) and resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuit models. From the perspective of electronic system security, electromagnetic (EM) side-chann"
