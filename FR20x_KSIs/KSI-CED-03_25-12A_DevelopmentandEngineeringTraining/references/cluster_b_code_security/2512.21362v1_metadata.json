  "summary": "Security in modern RISC-V processors demands more than functional correctness: It requires resilience to side-channel attacks. This paper evaluates the vulnerability of the side channel of the CVA6 RISC-V core by analyzing software-based AES encryption uses an RTL-level power profiling framework called VeriSide. This work represents that this design's Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) reveals significant leakage, enabling key recovery. These findings underscore the importance of early-stage RTL a"
