  "summary": "We study mixed-state entanglement measures in Einstein-Born-Infeld (EN-BI) massive gravity theory, a model exhibiting both Hawking-Page transitions and metal-insulator transitions (MIT) at finite temperatures. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), a novel mixed-state entanglement measure, demonstrates unique properties in detecting phase transitions. For MIT, we find the higher-order terms of EWCS align closely with the critical point, outperfo"
