  "summary": "What happens to a unified conscious field when its physical implementation straddles a black hole event horizon? This paper addresses that question for integration-based theories, including Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and Predictive Processing. These views share a structural commitment: unity requires a single strongly connected component (SCC) in an effective causal graph over a finite integration window $\u03c4$. Using the standard black hole causal structure, I show tha"
