  "summary": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) schemes are key exchange protocols based on the physical properties of quantum channels. They avoid the computational-hardness assumptions that underlie the security of classical key exchange. Continuous-Variable QKD (CVQKD), in contrast to qubit-based discrete-variable (DV) schemes, makes use of quadrature measurements of the electromagnetic field. CVQKD has the advantage of being compatible with standard telecom equipment, but at long distances has to deal with v"
