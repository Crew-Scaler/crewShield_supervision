  "summary": "Many network datasets exhibit connectivity with variance by resolution and large-scale organization that coexists with localized departures. When vertices have observed ordering or embedding, such as geography in spatial and village networks, or anatomical coordinates in connectomes, learning where and at what resolution connectivity departs from a baseline is crucial. Standard models typically emphasize a single representation, i.e. stochastic block models prioritize coarse partitions, latent s"
