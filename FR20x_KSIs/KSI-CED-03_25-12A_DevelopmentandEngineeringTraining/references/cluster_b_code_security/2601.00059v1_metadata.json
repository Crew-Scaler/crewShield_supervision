  "summary": "We explore the evolution of sub-Neptune (radii between $\\sim$1.5 and 4 R$_\\oplus$) exoplanet interior structures using our upgraded planetary evolution code, \\texttt{APPLE}, which self-consistently couples the thermal and compositional evolution of the whole structure. We incorporate stably stratified regions with convective mixing and, for the first time, ab initio results on the phase separation of silicate-hydrogen mixtures to model silicate rain in sub-Neptune envelopes. We demonstrate that "
