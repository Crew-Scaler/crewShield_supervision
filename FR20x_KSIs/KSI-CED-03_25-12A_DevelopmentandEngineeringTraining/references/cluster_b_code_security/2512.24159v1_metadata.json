  "summary": "Using an AI assistant, we developed a method for systematically constructing controlled natural language for requirements based on formal specification patterns containing logical attributes. The method involves three stages: 1) compiling a generalized natural language requirement pattern that utilizes all attributes of the formal specification template; 2) generating, using the AI assistant, a corpus of natural language requirement patterns, reduced by partially evaluating attributes (the devel"
