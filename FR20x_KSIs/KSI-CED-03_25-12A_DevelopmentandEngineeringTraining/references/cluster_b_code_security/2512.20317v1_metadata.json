  "summary": "The global impetus for extracting rare earth elements (REEs) is shaping the future of green technologies. From high-efficiency magnets in wind turbines to advanced batteries and solar photovoltaics, REEs are indispensable for a greener world through the energy transition. However, supply chains remain a barrier for the majority of the global population. India is mainly dependent on imports for most REEs. Innovation and recycling efforts in most REEs are still in their early stages. For India, as"
