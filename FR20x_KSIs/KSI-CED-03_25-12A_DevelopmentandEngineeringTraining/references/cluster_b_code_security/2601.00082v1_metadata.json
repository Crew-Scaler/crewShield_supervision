  "summary": "We present a phenomenological study of the discovery potential at the FCC-hh for a new heavy neutral vector boson, Z', predicted by the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. Focusing on the parameter space currently not excluded by Large Hadron Collider data, we analyze the dilepton production channel $p p \\rightarrow Z^{\\prime} \\rightarrow l^{+} l^{-}$ ($l^{\\pm} = e^{\\pm}, \u03bc^{\\pm}$) at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 100$ TeV. Full Monte Carlo simulations was performed for different ($M_{Z'}$, $g"
