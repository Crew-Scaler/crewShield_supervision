  "summary": "Despite its successes, the large-$N$ holographic dictionary remains incomplete. Key features of gravitational path integrals--most notably Euclidean wormholes and the associated failure of factorization--lack a clear interpretation in the standard large-$N$ framework. A related challenge is the possibility of erratic $N$-dependence in CFT observables, behavior with no evident semiclassical gravitational counterpart.\n  We argue that these puzzles point to a missing ingredient in the dictionary: a"
