  "summary": "As the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) serves as a fundamental component in random number generation and cryptographic applications, its performance and security are particularly critical in resource-constrained embedded systems, where memory capacity and computational efficiency are limited. Establishing a high-performance and secure DRBG is therefore an important issue for embedded system design. Furthermore, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established the A"
