  "summary": "The observation of resonant di-Higgs production, which would strongly suggest the existence of a new heavy neutral scalar $H$, has been searched for extensively at the LHC. In the two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with $m_H\\gg m_h$, where $h$ is the Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV observed at the LHC, we show that a direct correlation emerges between Br$(H\\to hh)$ and Br$(H\\to VV)$, with $V=Z,W$, which depends only on $m_H$ (and $m_V$). In particular, for heavy scalar masses between 500\\,GeV and 1\\,TeV"
