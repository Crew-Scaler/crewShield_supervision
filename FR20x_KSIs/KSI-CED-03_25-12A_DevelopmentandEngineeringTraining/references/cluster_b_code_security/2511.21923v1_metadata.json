  "summary": "Understanding how backdoor data influences neural network training dynamics remains a complex and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) "
