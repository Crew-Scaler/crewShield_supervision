  "summary": "As the core of the Internet infrastructure, the TCP/IP protocol stack undertakes the task of network data transmission. However, due to the complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction, there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol stack code and the RFC standard. This inconsistency may not only lead to differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security vulnerabilities. At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol "
