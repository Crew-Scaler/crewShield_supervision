  "summary": "Modern cloud architectures demand self-adaptive capabilities to manage dynamic operational conditions. Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, Ada"
