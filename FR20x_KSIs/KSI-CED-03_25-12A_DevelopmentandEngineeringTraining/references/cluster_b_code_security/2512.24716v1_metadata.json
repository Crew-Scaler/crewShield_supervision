  "summary": "The exponential growth of data transmission and processing speeds in modern digital infrastructure requires entropy sources capable of producing large volumes of true randomness for information security. Chaotic emissions from semiconductor lasers are attractive in this context because of their fast dynamics and nonrepetitive behavior. Their spectral bandwidth, however, is typically limited to several tens of gigahertz, which constrains the achievable entropy rate and makes ultrafast random bit "
