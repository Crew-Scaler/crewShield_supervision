  "summary": "Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems are poised to dominate industry and society imminently. Powered by goal-driven autonomy, they represent a powerful form of generative AI, marking a transition from reactive content generation into proactive multitasking capabilities. As an exemplar, we propose an architecture of a multi-agent system for the implementation phase of the software engineering process. We also present a comprehensive threat model for the proposed system. We demonstrate that while su"
