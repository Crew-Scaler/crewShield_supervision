  "summary": "Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetri"
