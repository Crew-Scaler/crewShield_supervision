  "summary": "The ability to connect visual patterns with the processes that form them represents one of the deepest forms of visual understanding. Textures of clouds and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We present the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the models and code that generate these ima"
