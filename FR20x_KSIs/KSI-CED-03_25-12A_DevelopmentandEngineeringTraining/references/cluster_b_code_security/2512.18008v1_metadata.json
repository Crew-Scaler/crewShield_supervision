  "summary": "We present the first fully explicit, continuous, analytically derived warp-drive spacetime within General Relativity whose shift-vector flow is kinematically irrotational. Building on Santiago \\emph{et al.} that scalar-potential, zero-vorticity warp fields are Hawking-Ellis Type I for unit lapse and flat spatial slices, we supply a closed-form scalar potential and smooth shift components with proper boundary behavior, together with a Cartan-tetrad analytic pipeline and high-precision eigenanalys"
