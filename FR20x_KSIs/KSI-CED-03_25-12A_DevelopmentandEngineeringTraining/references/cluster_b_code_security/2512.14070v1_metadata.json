  "summary": "JavaScript's widespread adoption has made it an attractive target for malicious attackers who employ sophisticated obfuscation techniques to conceal harmful code. Current deobfuscation tools suffer from critical limitations that severely restrict their practical effectiveness. Existing tools struggle with diverse input formats, address only specific obfuscation types, and produce cryptic output that impedes human analysis.\n  To address these challenges, we present JSIMPLIFIER, a comprehensive de"
