  "summary": "Much of the reported progress in file-level software defect prediction (SDP) is, in reality, nothing but an illusion of accuracy. Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware predict"
