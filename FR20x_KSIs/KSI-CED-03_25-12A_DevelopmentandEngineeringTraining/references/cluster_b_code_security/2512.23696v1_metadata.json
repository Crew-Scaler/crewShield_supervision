  "summary": "OpenPBR is a physically based, standardized uber-shader developed for interoperable material authoring and rendering across VFX, animation, and design visualization workflows. This document serves as a companion to the official specification, offering deeper insight into the model's development and more detailed implementation guidance, including code examples and mathematical derivations.\n  We begin with a description of the model's formal structure and theoretical foundations - covering slab-b"
