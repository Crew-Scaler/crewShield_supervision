  "summary": "We show that video generation models could reason now. Testing on tasks such as chess, maze, Sudoku, mental rotation, and Raven's Matrices, leading models such as Sora-2 achieve sixty percent success rates. We establish a robust experimental paradigm centered on the \"Task Pair\" design. We build a code framework, with 39 models available already, that supports this paradigm and allows for easy scaling - users can add models and tasks efficiently. We show our automated evaluation strongly correlat"
