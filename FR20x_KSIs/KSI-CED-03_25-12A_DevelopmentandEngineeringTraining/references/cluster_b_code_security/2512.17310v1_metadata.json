  "summary": "Pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRC) is a novel cryptographic primitive proposed at CRYPTO 2024. Due to the dual capability of pseudorandomness and error correction, PRC has been recognized as a promising foundational component for watermarking AI-generated content. However, the security of PRC has not been thoroughly analyzed, especially with concrete parameters or even in the face of cryptographic attacks. To fill this gap, we present the first cryptanalysis of PRC. We first propose three"
