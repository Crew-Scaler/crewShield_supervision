  "summary": "Building a working mental model of a protein typically requires weeks of reading, cross-referencing crystal and predicted structures, and inspecting ligand complexes, an effort that is slow, unevenly accessible, and often requires specialized computational skills. We introduce \\emph{Speak to a Protein}, a new capability that turns protein analysis into an interactive, multimodal dialogue with an expert co-scientist. The AI system retrieves and synthesizes relevant literature, structures, and lig"
