  "summary": "The separation of colloidal particles from fluids is essential to ensure a safe global supply of drinking water yet, in the case of microscopic particles, it remains a highly energy-intensive process when using traditional filtration methods. Water cleaning through diffusiophoresis $\\unicode{x2014}$spontaneous colloid migration in chemical gradients$\\unicode{x2014}$ effectively circumvents the need for physical filters, representing a promising alternative. This separation process is typically r"
