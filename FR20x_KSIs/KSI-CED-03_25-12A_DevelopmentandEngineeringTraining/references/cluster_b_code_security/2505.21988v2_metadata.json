  "summary": "Subgraph matching in logic circuits is foundational for numerous Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, including datapath optimization, arithmetic verification, and hardware trojan detection. However, existing techniques rely primarily on structural graph isomorphism and thus fail to identify function-related subgraphs when synthesis transformations substantially alter circuit topology. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce the concept of functional subgraph matching, a n"
