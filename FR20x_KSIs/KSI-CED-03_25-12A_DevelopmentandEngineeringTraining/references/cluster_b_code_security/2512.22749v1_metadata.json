  "summary": "We study the pricing behavior of third-party platforms facing strategic agents. Assuming the platform is a revenue maximizer, it observes market features that generally affect demand. Since only the equilibrium price and quantity are observable, this presents a general demand learning problem under confounding. Mathematically, we develop an algorithm with optimal regret of $\\Tilde{\\cO}(\\sqrt{T}\\wedge\u03c3_S^{-2})$. Our results reveal that supply-side noise fundamentally affects the learnability of d"
