  "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) power supply topologies, aiming to bridge the gap between DBD applications and power electronics design. Two key aspects are examined: the dependence of the DBD electrical model on reactor geometry, and application-driven requirements for injected waveform characteristics, including shapes, voltage amplitude, frequency, and modulation techniques. On this basis, the paper systematically reviews two major categories o"
