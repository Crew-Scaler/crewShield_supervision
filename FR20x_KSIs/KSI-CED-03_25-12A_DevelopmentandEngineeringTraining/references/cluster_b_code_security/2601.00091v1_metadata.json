  "summary": "We investigate Bayes posterior distributions in high-dimensional generalized linear models (GLMs) under the proportional asymptotics regime, where the number of features and samples diverge at a comparable rate. Specifically, we characterize the limiting behavior of finite-dimensional marginals of the posterior. We establish that the posterior does not contract in this setting. Yet, the finite-dimensional posterior marginals converge to Gaussian tilts of the prior, where the mean of the Gaussian"
