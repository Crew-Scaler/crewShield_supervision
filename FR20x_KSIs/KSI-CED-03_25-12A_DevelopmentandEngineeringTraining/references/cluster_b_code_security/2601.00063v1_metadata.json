  "summary": "We present an experimentally testable leptogenesis mechanism based on the standard type-I seesaw model that successfully operates at right-handed-neutrino (RHN) masses around the GeV scale. The mechanism takes place in a cosmological background with an asymmetry between right-handed electrons and left-handed positrons generated at high temperatures, and does not require oscillations between RHNs or any CP violation in the RHN sector. In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechan"
