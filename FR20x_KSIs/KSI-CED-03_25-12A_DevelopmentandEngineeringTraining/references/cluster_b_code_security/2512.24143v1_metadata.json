  "summary": "Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without sim"
