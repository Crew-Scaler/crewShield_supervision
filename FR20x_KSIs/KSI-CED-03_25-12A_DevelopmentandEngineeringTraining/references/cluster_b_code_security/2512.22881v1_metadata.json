  "summary": "Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided"
