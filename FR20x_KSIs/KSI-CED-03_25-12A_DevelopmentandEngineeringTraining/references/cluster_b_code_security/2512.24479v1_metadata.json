  "summary": "Solar flares are the largest energy-release events in the Solar System, allowing us to study fundamental physical phenomena under extreme conditions. Those include magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, radiation transport, and various plasma physics processes, all of which occur throughout the heliosphere and rest of the Universe. Flares and eruptive events are also components of geo-effective space weather. Their impacts from a space weather perspective are numerous, such as harm to sat"
