  "summary": "Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Lar"
