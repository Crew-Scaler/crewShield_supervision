  "summary": "The rapid appearance of large language models (LLMs) has led to systems that turn natural-language intent into real user interfaces (UIs). Free-form code generation maximizes expressiveness but often hurts reliability, security, and design-system compliance. In contrast, fully static UIs are easy to govern but lack adaptability. We present the Portal UX Agent, a practical middle way that makes bounded generation work: an LLM plans the UI at a high level, and a deterministic renderer assembles th"
