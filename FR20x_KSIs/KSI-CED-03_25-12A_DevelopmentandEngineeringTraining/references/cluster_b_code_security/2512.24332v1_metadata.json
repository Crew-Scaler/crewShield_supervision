  "summary": "The continuous growth of China's private passenger vehicle fleet has intensified material demand and embodied carbon emissions, underscoring the need for effective decarbonization pathways. This study develops a transferable, dynamic material flow analysis framework to assess vehicle stocks, metal flows (steel, aluminum, and copper), and embodied emissions from 2000 to 2070, and to quantify the contributions of demand-side and technology-side efficiency measures. The results reveal that: (1) The"
