  "summary": "To overcome inherent limitations of analog signals in over-the-air computation (AirComp), this letter proposes a two's complement-based coding scheme for the AirComp implementation with compatible digital modulations. Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the targ"
