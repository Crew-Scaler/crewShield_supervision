  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can be driven into over-generation, emitting thousands of tokens before producing an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime "
