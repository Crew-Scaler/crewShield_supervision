  "summary": "Deep learning (DL) compilers are core infrastructure in modern DL systems, offering flexibility and scalability beyond vendor-specific libraries. This work uncovers a fundamental vulnerability in their design: can an official, unmodified compiler alter a model's semantics during compilation and introduce hidden backdoors? We study both adversarial and natural settings. In the adversarial case, we craft benign models where triggers have no effect pre-compilation but become effective backdoors aft"
