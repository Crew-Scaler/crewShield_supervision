  "summary": "Browser agents enable autonomous web interaction but face critical reliability and security challenges in production. This paper presents findings from building and operating a production browser agent. The analysis examines where current approaches fail and what prevents safe autonomous operation. The fundamental insight: model capability does not limit agent performance; architectural decisions determine success or failure. Security analysis of real-world incidents reveals prompt injection att"
