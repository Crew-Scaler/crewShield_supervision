  "summary": "We consider the costs and benefits of embedding the states of one quantum system within those of another. Such embeddings are ubiquitous, e.g., in error correcting codes and in symmetry-constrained systems. In particular we investigate the impact of embeddings in terms of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness (also known as magic) quantified via the stabilizer entropy (SE). We analytically and numerically study the stabilizer entropy gap or magic gap: the average gap between the SE of a quant"
