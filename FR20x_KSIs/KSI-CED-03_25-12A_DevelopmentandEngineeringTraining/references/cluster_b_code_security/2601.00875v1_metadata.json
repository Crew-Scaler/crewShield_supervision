  "summary": "We investigate the factors contributing to departure and arrival delays at a major international airport and develop predictive models to estimate both the likelihood and duration of delays. Using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting methods, we identify key predictors of flight punctuality, including historical delay rates of flight numbers and airlines, weather conditions, runway traffic, walk time from security to gate, and overall airport congestion. Our models achieve s"
