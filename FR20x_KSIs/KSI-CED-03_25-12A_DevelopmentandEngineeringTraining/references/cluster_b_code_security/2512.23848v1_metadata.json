  "summary": "This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question "
