  "summary": "Magnetic monitoring of maritime environments is an important problem for monitoring and optimising shipping, as well as national security. New developments in compact, fibre-coupled quantum magnetometers have led to the opportunity to critically evaluate how best to create such a sensor network. Here we explore various magnetic sensor network architectures for target identification. Our modelling compares networks of scalar vs vector magnetometers. We implement an unscented Kalman filter approac"
