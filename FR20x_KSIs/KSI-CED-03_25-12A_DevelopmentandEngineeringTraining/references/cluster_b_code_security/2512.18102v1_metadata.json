  "summary": "Context: Exhaustive fuzzing of modern JavaScript engines is infeasible due to the vast number of program states and execution paths. Coverage-guided fuzzers waste effort on low-risk inputs, often ignoring vulnerability-triggering ones that do not increase coverage. Existing heuristics proposed to mitigate this require expert effort, are brittle, and hard to adapt.\n  Objective: We propose a data-centric, LLM-boosted alternative that learns from historical vulnerabilities to automatically identify"
