  "summary": "Modern networks generate vast, heterogeneous traffic that must be continuously analyzed for security and performance. Traditional network traffic analysis systems, whether rule-based or machine learning-driven, often suffer from high false positives and lack interpretability, limiting analyst trust. In this paper, we present ReGAIN, a multi-stage framework that combines traffic summarization, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for transparent and accur"
