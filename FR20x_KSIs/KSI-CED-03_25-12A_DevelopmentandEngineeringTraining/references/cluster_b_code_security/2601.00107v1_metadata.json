  "summary": "We introduce an affine invariant Langevin dynamics (ALDI) framework for the efficient estimation of rare events in nonlinear dynamical systems. Rare events are formulated as Bayesian inverse problems through a nonsmooth limit-state function whose zero level set characterises the event of interest. To overcome the nondifferentiability of this function, we propose a smooth approximation that preserves the failure set and yields a posterior distribution satisfying the small-noise limit.
