  "summary": "We study a multi-commodity Freeway Network Control (FNC) problem aiming at achieving optimal operation of a transportation network through the use of ramp metering and variable speed limits. Straightforward formulations of both single- and multi-commodity FNC problems based on the Cell Transmission Model are known to be non-convex, mainly due to the congestion effects at diverge junctions. However, recent studies have shown that it is possible to formulate a tight convex relaxation of the single"
