  "summary": "Passive radars (PRs) provide a low-cost and energy-efficient approach to object detection by reusing existing wireless transmissions instead of emitting dedicated probing signals. Yet, conventional passive systems require prior knowledge of non-cooperative source waveforms, are vulnerable to strong interference, and rely on Doppler signatures, limiting their ability to detect subtle or slow-moving targets. Here, we introduce a metasurface-enabled PR (MEPR) concept that integrates a space-time-co"
