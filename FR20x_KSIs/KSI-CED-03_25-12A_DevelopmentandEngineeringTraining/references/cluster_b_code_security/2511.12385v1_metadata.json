  "summary": "In recent years, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical approach for managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through code and automation. IaC enables organizations to create scalable and consistent environments, effectively managing servers and development settings. However, the growing complexity of cloud infrastructures has led to an increased risk of misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities in IaC scripts. To address this problem, this paper investigates the potentia"
