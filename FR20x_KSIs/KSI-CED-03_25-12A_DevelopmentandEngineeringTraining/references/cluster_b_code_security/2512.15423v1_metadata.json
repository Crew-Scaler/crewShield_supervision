  "summary": "Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) wit"
