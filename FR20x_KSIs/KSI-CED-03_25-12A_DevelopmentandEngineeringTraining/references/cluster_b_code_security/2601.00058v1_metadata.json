  "summary": "Motivated by the observation that $2+2=4$, we consider four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories on $S^2\\times\u03a3$, turning on a suitable rigid supergravity background. On the one hand, reduction of a four-dimensional theory ${T}$ on a Riemann surface $\u03a3$ leads to a family $\\mathscr{F}[{T}, \u03a3]$ of two-dimensional $(2,2)$ unitary SCFTs, a two-dimensional analog of the four-dimensional theories of class $\\mathscr{S}$. On the other hand, reduction on $S^2$ yields a non-unitary tw"
