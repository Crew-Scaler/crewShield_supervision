  "summary": "In his 1984 Turing Award lecture, Ken Thompson showed that a compiler could be maliciously altered to insert backdoors into programs it compiles and perpetuate this behavior by modifying any compiler it subsequently builds. Thompson's hack has been reproduced in real-world systems for demonstration purposes. Several countermeasures have been proposed to defend against Thompson-style backdoors, including the well-known {\\it Diverse Double-Compiling} (DDC) technique, as well as methods like transl"
