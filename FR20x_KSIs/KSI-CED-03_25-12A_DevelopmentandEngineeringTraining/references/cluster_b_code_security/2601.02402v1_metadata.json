  "summary": "Rural healthcare faces numerous challenges, including limited access to specialized medical services and diagnostic equipment, which delays patient care. Enhancing the ability to transmit medical images and data from rural areas to urban hospitals via wireless networks is critical. However, bandwidth limitations, unreliable networks, and concerns over data security and privacy hinder efficient transmission. Additionally, the high data volume of medical content and the limited battery life of IoT"
