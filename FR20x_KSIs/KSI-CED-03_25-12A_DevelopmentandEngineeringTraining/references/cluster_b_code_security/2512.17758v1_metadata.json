  "summary": "We introduce a general, simple, and computationally efficient framework for predicting day-ahead supply and demand merit-order curves, from which both point and probabilistic electricity price forecasts can be derived. Specifically, we leverage functional principal component analysis to efficiently represent a pair of supply and demand curves in a low-dimensional vector space and employ regularized vector autoregressive models for their prediction. We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of p"
