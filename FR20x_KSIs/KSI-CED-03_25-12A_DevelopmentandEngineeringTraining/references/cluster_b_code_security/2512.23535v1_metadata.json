  "summary": "This paper presents a private transfer architecture for the Internet Computer (ICP) that decouples deposit and retrieval through two short-lived intermediaries, with sealed storage and attested teardown by an ephemeral witness. The protocol uses a non-interactive RDMPF-based encapsulation to derive per-transfer transport keys. A public notice hint is computed from the capsule to enable discovery without fingerprinting the recipient's key. Retrieval is authorized by a short proof of decapsulation"
