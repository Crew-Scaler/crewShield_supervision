  "summary": "The digital economy runs on Open Source Software (OSS), with an estimated 90\\% of modern applications containing open-source components. While this widespread adoption has revolutionized software development, it has also created critical security vulnerabilities, particularly in essential but under-resourced projects. This paper examines a sophisticated attack on the XZ Utils project (CVE-2024-3094), where attackers exploited not just code, but the entire open-source development process to injec"
