  "summary": "While AI coding tools have demonstrated potential to accelerate software development, their use in scientific computing raises critical questions about code quality and scientific validity. In this paper, we provide ten practical rules for AI-assisted coding that balance leveraging capabilities of AI with maintaining scientific and methodological rigor. We address how AI can be leveraged strategically throughout the development cycle with four key themes: problem preparation and understanding, m"
