  "summary": "Optimal control provides a principled framework for transforming dynamical system models into intelligent decision-making, yet classical computational approaches are often too expensive for real-time deployment in dynamic or uncertain environments. In this work, we propose a method based on self-supervised neural operators for open-loop optimal control problems. It offers a new paradigm by directly approximating the mapping from system conditions to optimal control strategies, enabling instantan"
