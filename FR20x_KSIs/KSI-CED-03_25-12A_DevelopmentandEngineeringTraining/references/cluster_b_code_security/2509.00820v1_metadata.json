  "summary": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), safeguarding intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly critical. To address the challenges of high costs and potential contamination in fingerprint integration, we propose LoRA-FP, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that embeds backdoor fingerprints into LoRA adapters through constrained fine-tuning. This design enables seamless fingerprint transplantation via parameter fusion, eliminating the need for full-parameter update"
