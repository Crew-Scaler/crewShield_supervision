  "summary": "The real estate sector remains highly dependent on manual document handling and verification, making processes inefficient and prone to fraud. This work presents a system that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing (NLP), and verifiable credentials (VCs) to automate document extraction, verification, and management. The approach standardizes heterogeneous document formats into VCs and applies automated data matching to detect inconsistencies, while the blockc"
