  "summary": "Multipartite entangled states possess a number of non-intuitive properties, making them a useful resource for various quantum information-processing tasks. The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the "
