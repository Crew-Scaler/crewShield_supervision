  "summary": "Online joint estimation of unknown parameters and states in a dynamical system with uncertainty quantification is crucial in many applications. For example, digital twins dynamically update their knowledge of model parameters and states to support prediction and decision-making. Reliability and computational speed are vital for DTs. Online parameter-state estimation ensures computational efficiency, while uncertainty quantification is essential for making reliable predictions and decisions. In p"
