  "summary": "The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary level, enabling real-time detection withou"
