  "summary": "This document presents a concise overview of the contemporary research directions in quantum computer cybersecurity. The aim of this document is not to be a survey, but rather a succinct summary of the major research directions in quantum computer cybersecurity at the end of the first half of the current decade. The document has been inspired by the presentations and discussions held at the 3$^{rd}$ Quantum Computer Cybersecurity Symposium, but goes beyond the contents of the symposium and aims "
