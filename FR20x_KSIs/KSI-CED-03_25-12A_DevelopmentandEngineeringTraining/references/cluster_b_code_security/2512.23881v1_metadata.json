  "summary": "Audio-language models combine audio encoders with large language models to enable multimodal reasoning, but they also introduce new security vulnerabilities. We propose a universal targeted latent space attack, an encoder-level adversarial attack that manipulates audio latent representations to induce attacker-specified outputs in downstream language generation. Unlike prior waveform-level or input-specific attacks, our approach learns a universal perturbation that generalizes across inputs and "
