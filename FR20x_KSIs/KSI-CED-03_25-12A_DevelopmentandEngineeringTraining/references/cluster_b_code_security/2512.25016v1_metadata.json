  "summary": "Genome rearrangement distances are an established method in genome comparison. Works in this area may include various rearrangement operations representing large-scale mutations, gene orientation information, the number of nucleotides in intergenic regions, and weights reflecting the expected frequency of each operation. In this article, we model genomes containing at most one copy of each gene by considering gene sequences, with orientations, and representing intergenic regions according to the"
