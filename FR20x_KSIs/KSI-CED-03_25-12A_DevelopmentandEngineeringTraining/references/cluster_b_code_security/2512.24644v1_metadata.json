  "summary": "Single-walled carbon nanotubes are one-dimensional $sp^2$ carbon materials whose electronic and optical properties are governed by their chirality. Catalytic chemical vapor deposition often uses transition-metal nanoparticles that liquefy at elevated temperature, and vapor-liquid-solid growth is commonly associated with broad chirality distributions. Improved selectivity has been reported for high-melting-point catalysts that remain solid, suggesting vapor-solid-solid growth, but the underlying "
