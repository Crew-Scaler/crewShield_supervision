  "summary": "We frame Ethereum transactions reverted by invariants-require(&lt;invariant&gt;)/ assert(&lt;invariant&gt;)/if (&lt;invariant&gt;) revert statements in the contract implementation-as a positive signal of active on-chain defenses. Despite their value, the defensive patterns in these transactions remain undiscovered and underutilized in security research. We present Raven, a framework that aligns reverted transactions to the invariant causing the reversion in the smart contract source code, embeds"
