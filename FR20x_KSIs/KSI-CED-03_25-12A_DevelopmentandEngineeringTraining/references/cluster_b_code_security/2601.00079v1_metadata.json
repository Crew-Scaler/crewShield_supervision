  "summary": "Long gamma-ray bursts (lGRB) are produced by relativistic jets arising from the collapse of massive stars. Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient fram"
