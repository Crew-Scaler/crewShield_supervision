  "summary": "Building custom data analysis platforms traditionally requires extensive software engineering expertise, limiting accessibility for many researchers. Here, I demonstrate that modern large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents can dramatically lower this barrier through a process called 'vibe coding', an iterative, conversational style of software creation where users describe goals in natural language and AI agents generate, test, and refine executable code in real-time. As a proof"
