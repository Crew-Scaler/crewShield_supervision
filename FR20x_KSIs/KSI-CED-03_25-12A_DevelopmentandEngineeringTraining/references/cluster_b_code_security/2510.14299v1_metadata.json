  "summary": "As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++, a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that evade existing defences. TED++ begins by"
