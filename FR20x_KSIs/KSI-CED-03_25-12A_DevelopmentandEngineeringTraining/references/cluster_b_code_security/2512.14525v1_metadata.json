  "summary": "Background: Commercially available ionization chambers (ICs) exposed to ultra-high dose per pulse (DPP) exhibit deviations from a linear dose response due to volume recombination. In the last years, phenomenological and simulation models have been developed to describe the charge collection efficiency (CCE) focused on parallel-plate ICs.\n  Methods: The response of two PinPoint3D T31022 (PP3D) and two PinPoint T31023 (PP) ICs was investigated experimentally at the national metrology institute of "
