  "summary": "We identify universal polar dual pairs of spherical codes $C$ and $D$ such that for a large class of potential functions $h$ the minima of the discrete $h$-potential of $C$ on the sphere occur at the points of $D$ and vice versa. Moreover, the minimal values of their normalized potentials are equal. These codes arise from the known sharp codes embedded in the even unimodular extremal lattices $E_8$ and $\u039b_{24}$ (Leech lattice). This embedding allows us to use the lattices' properties to find new"
