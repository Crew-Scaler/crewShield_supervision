  "summary": "As post-quantum cryptography (PQC) becomes increasingly critical for securing future communication systems, the performance overhead introduced by quantum-resistant algorithms presents a major computing challenge. HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) is a newly standardized code-based PQC scheme designed to replace classical key exchange methods. In this paper, we propose OptHQC, an optimized implementation of the HQC scheme to deliver high-performance cryptographic operations. Our approach provides a com"
