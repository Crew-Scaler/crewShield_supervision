  "summary": "Using the 1D Monte Carlo-based radiative transfer code TARDIS, we investigate the spectral evolution of the Type Iax supernova (SN) 2020rea from -7 days before to +21 days after maximum light. Our best-fit models indicate stratified, velocity-dependent abundances at early times, successfully reproducing most observed spectral features. As the SN evolves, the ejecta transition from a layered to a more homogeneous composition, posing an alternative to pure deflagration models that predict fully mi"
