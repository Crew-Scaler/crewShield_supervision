  "summary": "We propose an extension to the OWASP Multi-Agentic System (MAS) Threat Modeling Guide, translating recent anticipatory research in multi-agent security (MASEC) into practical guidance for addressing challenges unique to large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent architectures. Although OWASP's existing taxonomy covers many attack vectors, our analysis identifies gaps in modeling failures, including, but not limited to: reasoning collapse across planner-executor chains, metric overfitting, uns"
