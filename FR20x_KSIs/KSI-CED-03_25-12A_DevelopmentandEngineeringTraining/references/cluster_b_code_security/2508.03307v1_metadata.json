  "summary": "In this paper, we endeavor to address the challenges of backdoor attacks countermeasures in black-box scenarios, thereby fortifying the security of inference under MLaaS. We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new perspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into: high-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and low-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a progressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these t"
