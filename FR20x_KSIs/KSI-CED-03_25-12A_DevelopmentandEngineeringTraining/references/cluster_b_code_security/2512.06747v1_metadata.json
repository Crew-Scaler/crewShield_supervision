  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful enablers for autonomous reasoning and natural-language coordination in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms operating within Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, existing LLM-driven UAV systems process sensitive operational data in plaintext, exposing them to privacy and security risks. This work introduces PrivLLMSwarm, a privacy-preserving framework that performs secure LLM inference for UAV swarm coordination through Secure Mult"
