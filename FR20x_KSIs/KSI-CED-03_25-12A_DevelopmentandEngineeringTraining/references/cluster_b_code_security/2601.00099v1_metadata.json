  "summary": "Understanding how interparticle interactions govern phase behavior is central to controlling self-organization in multicomponent soft-matter systems. In particular, the role of cross-interactions between unlike components remains insufficiently understood. Here, we systematically investigate how cross-interaction character controls phase behavior in binary mixtures of hard and soft particles using coarse-grained modeling, Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) theory, and molecular dynamics sim"
