  "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been used to generate human-like content across multiple domains (e.g., sound, image, text, and programming). However, their reliability in terms of correctness and functionality in novel contexts such as programmable networks remains unclear. Hence, this paper presents an empirical evaluation of the source code of a POX controller generated by different AI tools, namely ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, and BlackBox.ai. To evaluate such a code, three"
