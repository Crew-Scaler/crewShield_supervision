  "summary": "Sensitive information leakage in code repositories has emerged as a critical security challenge. Traditional detection methods that rely on regular expressions, fingerprint features, and high-entropy calculations often suffer from high false-positive rates. This not only reduces detection efficiency but also significantly increases the manual screening burden on developers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaborative architectures have demonstrated remarkable po"
