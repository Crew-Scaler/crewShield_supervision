  "summary": "We use the Gaussian approximation describing photocount statistics for both the homodyne and the double homodyne (heterodyne) measurements to study asymmetry effects arising from imbalance of the beam splitters and variations in quantum efficiencies of the photodetectors. After computing the $Q$ symbols of the positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of noisy measurements that take into account the asymmetry effects, the operator representations for the POVMs are obtained in the form that assum"
