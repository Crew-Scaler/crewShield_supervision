  "summary": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across a wide range of practical applications. However, long-context inference remains a significant challenge due to the substantial memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to several gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PackKV}, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-context generation. %, which syner"
