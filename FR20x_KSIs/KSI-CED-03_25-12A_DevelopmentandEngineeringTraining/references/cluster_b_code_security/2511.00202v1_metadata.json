  "summary": "``Vibe coding'' -- the practice of developing software through iteratively conversing with a large language model (LLM) -- has exploded in popularity within the last year. However, developers report key limitations including the accumulation of technical debt, security issues, and code churn to achieve satisfactory results. We argue that these pitfalls result from LLMs' inability to reconcile accumulating human-imposed constraints during vibe coding, with developers inadvertently failing to reso"
