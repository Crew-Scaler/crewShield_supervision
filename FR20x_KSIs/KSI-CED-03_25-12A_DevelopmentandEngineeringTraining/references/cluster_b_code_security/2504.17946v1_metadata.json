  "summary": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often rely on statistical correlations rather than causal reasoning, limiting their robustness and interpretability. While testing methods can identify failures, effective debugging and repair remain challenging. This paper explores causal inference as an approach primarily for DNN repair, leveraging causal debugging, counterfactual analysis, and structural causal models (SCMs) to identify and correct failures. We discuss in what ways these techniques support fairness"
