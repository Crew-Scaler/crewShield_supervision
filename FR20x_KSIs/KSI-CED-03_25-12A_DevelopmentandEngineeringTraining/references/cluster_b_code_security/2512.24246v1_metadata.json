  "summary": "Incorporating item-side information, such as category and brand, into sequential recommendation is a well-established and effective approach for improving performance. However, despite significant advancements, current models are generally limited by three key challenges: they often overlook the fine-grained temporal dynamics inherent in timestamps, exhibit vulnerability to noise in user interaction sequences, and rely on computationally expensive fusion architectures. To systematically address "
