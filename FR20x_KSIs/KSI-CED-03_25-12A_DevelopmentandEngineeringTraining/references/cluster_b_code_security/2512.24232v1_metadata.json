  "summary": "We investigate random spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) code ensembles over finite fields. Under different variable-node edge-spreading rules, the random Tanner graphs of several coupled ensembles are defined by multiple independent, uniformly random monomial maps. The two main coupled ensembles considered are referred to as the standard coupled ensemble and the improved coupled ensemble. We prove that both coupled ensembles exhibit asymptotically good minimum distance and min"
