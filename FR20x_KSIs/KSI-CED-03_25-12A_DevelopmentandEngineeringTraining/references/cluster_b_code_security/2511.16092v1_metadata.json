  "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models are achieving remarkable performance in various tasks, including code generation, testing, code review, and program repair. The ability to increase the level of abstraction away from writing code has the potential to change the Human-AI interaction within the integrated development environment (IDE). To explore the impact of GenAI on IDEs, 33 experts from the Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Computer Interaction domains ga"
