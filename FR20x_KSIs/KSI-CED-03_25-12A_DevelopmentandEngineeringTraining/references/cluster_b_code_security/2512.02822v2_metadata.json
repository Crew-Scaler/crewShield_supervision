  "summary": "We present a novel approach to post-quantum cryptography that employs directed-graph decryption of noise-enhanced high-memory convolutional codes. The proposed construction generates random-like generator matrices that effectively conceal algebraic structure and resist known structural attacks. Security is further reinforced by the deliberate injection of strong noise during decryption, arising from polynomial division: while legitimate recipients retain polynomial-time decoding, adversaries fac"
