  "summary": "Hierarchical organization is a fundamental structure in real-world society, where authority and responsibility are delegated from managers to subordinates. The VIRGO network (Virtual Hierarchical Overlay Network for scalable grid computing) provides a scalable overlay for organizing distributed systems but lacks intrinsic security and privacy mechanisms. This paper proposes Private Virtual Tree Networks (PVTNs), a cryptographically enforced extension that leverages the VIRGO overlay to mirror re"
