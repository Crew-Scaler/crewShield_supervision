  "summary": "Spectral complexity is a useful resource in physical device identification, disorder-enhanced spectroscopy, and machine learning, but is often achieved in chip-scale devices at the expense of propagation loss, scalability, or reconfigurability. In this work, we demonstrate that device specific spectral complexity can be achieved using completely standardized photonic building blocks. Using a waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer internally loaded with two sets of non-concentric dual ring resonat"
