  "summary": "This paper introduces UnitTenX, a state-of-the-art open-source AI multi-agent system designed to generate unit tests for legacy code, enhancing test coverage and critical value testing. UnitTenX leverages a combination of AI agents, formal methods, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test generation, addressing the challenges posed by complex and legacy codebases. Despite the limitations of LLMs in bug detection, UnitTenX offers a robust framework for improving software reliability and "
