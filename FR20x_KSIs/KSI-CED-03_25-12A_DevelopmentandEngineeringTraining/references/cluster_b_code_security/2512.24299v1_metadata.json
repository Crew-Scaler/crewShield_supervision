  "summary": "From NBODY1 to NBODY6 : The Growth of an Industry is the title of a 1999 invited review by Sverre Aarseth, for Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP). I took this as an inspiration for the title of this paper; it describes how Sverres NBODY Industry has further grown since 90s of the previous century, and how it is further flourishing and hopefully developing, in his spirit, even after the sad news of his passing away reached us. My contact and friendship with Sverre star"
