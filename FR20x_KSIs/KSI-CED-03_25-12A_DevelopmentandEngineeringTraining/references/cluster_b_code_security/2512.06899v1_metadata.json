  "summary": "Transferable backdoors pose a severe threat to the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) supply chain, yet defensive research remains nascent, primarily relying on detecting anomalies in the output feature space. We identify a critical flaw that fine-tuning on downstream tasks inevitably modifies model parameters, shifting the output distribution and rendering pre-computed defense ineffective. To address this, we propose Patronus, a novel framework that use input-side invariance of triggers against"
