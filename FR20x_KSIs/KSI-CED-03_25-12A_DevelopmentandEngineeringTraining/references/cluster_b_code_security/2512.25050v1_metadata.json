  "summary": "We introduce a new approach for analyzing ancient solutions and singularities of mean curvature flow that are locally modeled on a cylinder. Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \\emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.\n  As an application, "
