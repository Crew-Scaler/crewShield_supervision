  "summary": "RoboEarth was a pioneering initiative in cloud robotics, establishing a foundational framework for robots to share and exchange knowledge about actions, objects, and environments through a standardized knowledge graph. Initially, this knowledge was predominantly hand-crafted by engineers using RDF triples within OWL Ontologies, with updates, such as changes in an object's pose, being asserted by the robot's control and perception routines. However, with the advent and rapid development of Large "
