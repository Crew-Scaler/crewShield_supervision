  "summary": "The rapid growth of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced system inertia and increased the need for fast frequency response (FFR) in modern power systems. Data centers, as large and flexible electrical consumers, hold great potential to contribute to frequency stabilization due to their controllable IT workloads and on-site uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging data centers for providing fast frequency response through real"
