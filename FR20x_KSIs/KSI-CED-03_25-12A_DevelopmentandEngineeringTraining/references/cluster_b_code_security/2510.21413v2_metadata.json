  "summary": "GenAI-based coding assistants have disrupted software development. Their next generation is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without human oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context about the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require contextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target architecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows, and other project-specific poli"
