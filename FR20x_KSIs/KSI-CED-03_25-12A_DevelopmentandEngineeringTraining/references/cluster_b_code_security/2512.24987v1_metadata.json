  "summary": "Axial algebras of Monster type are a class of non-associative algebras which generalise the Griess algebra, whose automorphism group is the largest sporadic simple group, the Monster. The $2$-generated algebras, which are the building blocks from which all algebras in this class can be constructed, have recently been classified by Yabe; Franchi and Mainardis; and Franchi, Mainardis and McInroy. There are twelve infinite families of examples as well as the exceptional Highwater algebra and its co"
