  "summary": "With the development of customized large language model (LLM) agents, a new threat of black-box backdoor attacks has emerged, where malicious instructions are injected into hidden system prompts. These attacks easily bypass existing defenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To address this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided CoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based on two key insights. First,"
