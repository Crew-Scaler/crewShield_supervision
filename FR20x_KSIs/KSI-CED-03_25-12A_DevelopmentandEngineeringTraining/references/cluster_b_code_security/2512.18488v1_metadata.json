  "summary": "Secure interoperability across heterogeneous blockchains remains one of the most pressing challenges in Web3 with existing bridge protocols vulnerable to both classical exploits and emerging quantum threats. This paper introduces QLink a quantum-safe Layer 3 interoperability protocol that integrates postquantum cryptography (PQC) quantum key distribution (QKD) and hardware security modules (HSMs) into a unified validator architecture. To our knowledge, QLink is the first interoperability framewo"
