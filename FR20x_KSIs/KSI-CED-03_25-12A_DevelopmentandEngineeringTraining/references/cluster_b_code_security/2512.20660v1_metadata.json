  "summary": "Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is tr"
