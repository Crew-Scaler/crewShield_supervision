  "summary": "AI workloads are turning large data centers into highly dynamic power-electronic loads; fault-time behavior and workload pulsing can stress weak-grid points of interconnection. This paper proposes a centralized medium-voltage (MV) uninterruptible power supply (UPS) control architecture implemented as three operating modes: Mode 1 regulates a DC stiff bus and shapes normal-operation grid draw, Mode 2 enforces current-limited fault-mode P--Q priority with UPS battery energy storage system (UPS-BES"
