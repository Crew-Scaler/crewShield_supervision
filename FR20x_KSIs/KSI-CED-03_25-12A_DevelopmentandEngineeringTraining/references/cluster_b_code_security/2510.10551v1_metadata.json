  "summary": "The integration of generative AI tools like ChatGPT into software engineering workflows opens up new opportunities to boost productivity in tasks such as unit test engineering. However, these AI-assisted workflows can also significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control, output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in software testing interact with generative AI for en"
