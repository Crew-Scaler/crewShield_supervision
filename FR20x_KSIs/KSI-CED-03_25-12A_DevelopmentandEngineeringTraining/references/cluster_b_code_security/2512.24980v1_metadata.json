  "summary": "We introduce a two-sort weighted modal logic for possibilistic reasoning with fuzzy formal contexts. The syntax of the logic includes two types of weighted modal operators corresponding to classical necessity ($\\Box$) and sufficiency ($\\boxminus$) modalities and its formulas are interpreted in fuzzy formal contexts based on possibility theory. We present its axiomatization that is \\emph{sound} with respect to the class of all fuzzy context models. In addition, both the necessity and sufficiency "
