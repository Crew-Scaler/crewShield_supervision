  "summary": "We prove that the local limit of the weighted spanning trees on any simple connected high degree almost regular sequence of electric networks is the Poisson(1) branching process conditioned to survive forever, by generalizing [NP22] and closing a gap in their proof. We also study the local statistics of the WST's on high degree almost balanced sequences, which is interesting even for the uniform spanning trees.\n  Our motivation comes from studying an interpolation $\\{\\mathsf{WST}^\u03b2(G)\\}_{\u03b2\\in [0"
