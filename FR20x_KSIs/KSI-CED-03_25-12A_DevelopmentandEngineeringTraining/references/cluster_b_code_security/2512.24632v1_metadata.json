  "summary": "In collaborative settings, difficulties in sustaining a consistent pace and engagement often lead to task drift, reducing preparedness and overall effectiveness between meetings. To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study and developed ReflecToMeet, an AI assisted system that integrates theory driven reflective prompts with mechanisms for sharing teammates reflections. Informed by ten formative interviews, the system was evaluated in a mixed method study across three conditions: d"
