This paper (Paper D) unifies the ideal-theoretic, computational, and homological layers developed in Papers A (Rao 2025), B (Rao 2025), and C (Rao 2025) into a geometric framework that includes fuzzy and computational geometries on the spectrum Spec_G(T) and derived invariants in TGMod.\n  Scope. We construct structure sheaves and Grothendieck topologies adapted to ternary G-products, develop fuzzy and weighted sites, and prove dualities bridging primitive spectra, Schur-density embeddings, "
