  "summary": "In this paper, we present \\textit{CTMAP}, a large language model (LLM) empowered digital twin framework for connectivity-aware route navigation in millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless networks. Conventional navigation tools optimize only distance, time, or cost, overlooking network connectivity degradation caused by signal blockage in dense urban environments. The proposed framework constructs a digital twin of the physical mmWave network using OpenStreetMap, Blender, and NVIDIA Sionna's ray-tracin"
