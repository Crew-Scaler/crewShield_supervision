  "summary": "A feedback control system is proposed for balancing the deviations of water levels from set-points along open channels subject to uncertain supply-demand mismatch that exceeds individual pool capacity. Decentralized controllers adjust the gate flows between pools to regulate potentially weighted differences between neighbouring water-level errors to zero in steady state. A sequential SISO loop-shaping procedure is developed for the design of each local flow controller based on distributed parame"
