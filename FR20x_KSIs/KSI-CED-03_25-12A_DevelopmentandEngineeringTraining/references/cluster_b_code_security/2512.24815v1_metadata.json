  "summary": "Wireless powered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) faces a fundamental tradeoff between energy supply, communication throughput, and sensing accuracy. This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is charac"
