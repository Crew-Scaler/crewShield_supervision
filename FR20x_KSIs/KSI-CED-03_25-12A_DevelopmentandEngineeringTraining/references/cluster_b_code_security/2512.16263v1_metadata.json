  "summary": "This paper proposes a black-start method for an off-grid wind-to-hydrogen (W2H) system comprising a wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) serving as the black-start power source, and a hydrogen production industry. The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC th"
