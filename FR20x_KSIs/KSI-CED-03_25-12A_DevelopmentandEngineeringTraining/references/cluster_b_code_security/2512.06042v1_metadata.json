  "summary": "Machine learning (ML) models for code clone detection determine whether two pieces of code are semantically equivalent, which in turn is a key building block for software-engineering tasks like refactoring and security tasks like vulnerability and malware detection. While these models are predominantly trained on clean, structured code datasets, real-world code often undergoes a variety of semantic-preserving transformations, including refactoring, minification, automated formatting, and compile"
