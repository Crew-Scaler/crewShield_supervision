  "summary": "The VBphenoR package for R provides a closed-form variational Bayes approach to patient phenotyping using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. We implement a variational Bayes Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm using closed-form coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) to determine the patient phenotype latent class. We then implement a variational Bayes logistic regression, where we determine the probability of the phenotype in the supplied EHR cohort, the shift in biomarkers for pat"
