  "summary": "Deep Learning (DL) compilers have been widely utilized to optimize DL models for efficient deployment across various hardware. Due to their vital role in the DL ecosystem, ensuring their reliability and security is critical. However, existing approaches have limitations in testing optimization stages, which is the core functionality of DL compilers, due to the difficulty in generating optimization-aware tests. In this paper, we proposed OATest, a novel approach for synthesizing optimization-awar"
