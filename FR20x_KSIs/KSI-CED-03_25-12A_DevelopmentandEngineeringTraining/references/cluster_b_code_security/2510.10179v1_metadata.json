  "summary": "The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model scalability and programmability. However, as a new la"
