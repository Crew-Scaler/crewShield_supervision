  "summary": "Semantic communications (SemCom), as one of the key technologies for 6G, is shifting networks from bit transmission to semantic information exchange. On this basis, introducing agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with perception, memory, reasoning, and action capabilities provides a practicable path to intelligent communications. This paper provides a systematic exposition of how agentic AI empowers SemCom from the perspectives of research foundations, system architecture, and application scena"
