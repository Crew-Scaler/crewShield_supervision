  "summary": "Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. "
