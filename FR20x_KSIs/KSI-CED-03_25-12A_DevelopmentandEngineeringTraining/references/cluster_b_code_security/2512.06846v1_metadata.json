  "summary": "Traditional approaches for smart contract analysis often rely on intermediate representations such as abstract syntax trees, control-flow graphs, or static single assignment form. However, these methods face limitations in capturing both semantic structures and control logic. Knowledge graphs, by contrast, offer a structured representation of entities and relations, enabling richer intermediate abstractions of contract code and supporting the use of graph query languages to identify rule-violati"
