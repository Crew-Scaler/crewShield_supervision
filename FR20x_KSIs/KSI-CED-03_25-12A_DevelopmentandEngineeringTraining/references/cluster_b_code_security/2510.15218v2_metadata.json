  "summary": "We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes (including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain, and generalized epilepsy) are selected.
