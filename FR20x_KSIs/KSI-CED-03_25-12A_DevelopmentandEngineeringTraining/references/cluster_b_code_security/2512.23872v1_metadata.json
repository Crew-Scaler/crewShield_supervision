  "summary": "We introduce the first example of algebraically constructed hierarchical quasi-cyclic codes. These codes are built from Reed-Solomon codes using a 1964 construction of superimposed codes by Kautz and Singleton. We show both the number of levels in the hierarchy and the index of these Reed-Solomon derived codes are determined by the field size. We show that this property also holds for certain additional classes of polynomial evaluation codes.\n  We provide explicit code parameters and properties "
