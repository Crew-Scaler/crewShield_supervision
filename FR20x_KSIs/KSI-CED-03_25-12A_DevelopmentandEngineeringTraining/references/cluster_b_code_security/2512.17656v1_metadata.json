  "summary": "In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing-and-communication (ISAC) network enabled by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is supposed to fly along a periodical circular trajectory at a fixed height for ISAC service supply from the sky. We consider on-demand sensing services, where on-demand detection and on-demand localization requests may be activated at any time toward any position within the targeted serving region. While guaranteeing satisfactory accuracy for both on-demand s"
