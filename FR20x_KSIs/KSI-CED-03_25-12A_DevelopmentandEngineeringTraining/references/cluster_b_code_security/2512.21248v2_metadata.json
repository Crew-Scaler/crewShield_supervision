  "summary": "Lateral movement is a tactic that adversaries employ most frequently in enterprise IT environments to traverse between assets. In operational technology (OT) environments, however, few methods exist for lateral movement between domain-specific devices, particularly programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Existing techniques often rely on complex chains of vulnerabilities, which are noisy and can be patched. This paper describes the first PLC-centric lateral movement technique that relies exclusiv"
