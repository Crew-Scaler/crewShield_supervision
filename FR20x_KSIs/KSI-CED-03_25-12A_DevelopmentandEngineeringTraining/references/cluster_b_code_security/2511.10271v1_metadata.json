  "summary": "In recent years, LLMs have been widely integrated into software engineering workflows, supporting tasks like code generation. However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investiga"
