  "summary": "Currently, artificial intelligence is profoundly transforming the audio domain; however, numerous advanced algorithms and tools remain fragmented, lacking a unified and efficient framework to unlock their full potential. Existing audio agent frameworks often suffer from complex environment configurations and inefficient tool collaboration. To address these limitations, we introduce AudioFab, an open-source agent framework aimed at establishing an open and intelligent audio-processing ecosystem. "
