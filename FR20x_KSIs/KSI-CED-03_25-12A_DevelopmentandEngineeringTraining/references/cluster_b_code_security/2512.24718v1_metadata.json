  "summary": "Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) features a high key rate and compatibility with classical optical communication. Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II op"
