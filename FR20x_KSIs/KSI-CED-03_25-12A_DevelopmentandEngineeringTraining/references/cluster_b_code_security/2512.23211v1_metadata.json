  "summary": "We study the identification of differentiated product demand with exogenous supply-side instruments, allowing product characteristics to be endogenous. Past analyses have argued that exogenous characteristic-based instruments are essentially necessary given a sufficiently flexible demand model with a suitable index restriction. We show, however, that price counterfactuals are nonparametrically identified by recentered instruments -- which combine exogenous shocks to prices with endogenous produc"
