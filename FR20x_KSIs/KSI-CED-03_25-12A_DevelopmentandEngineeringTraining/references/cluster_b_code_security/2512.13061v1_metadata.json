  "summary": "Measuring collaborative problem solving (CPS) synergy remains challenging in learning analytics, as classical manual coding cannot capture emergent system-level dynamics. This study introduces a computational framework that integrates automated discourse analysis with the Synergy Degree Model (SDM) to quantify CPS synergy from group communication. Data were collected from 52 learners in 12 groups during a 5-week connectivist MOOC (cMOOC) activity. Nine classification models were applied to autom"
