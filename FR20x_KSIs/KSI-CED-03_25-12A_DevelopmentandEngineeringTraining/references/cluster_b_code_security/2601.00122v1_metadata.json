  "summary": "In this work, we prove that the permutation group of a Reed-Solomon code is given by the polynomials of degree one that leave the set of evaluation points invariant. Our results provide a straightforward proof of the well-known cases of the permutation group of the Reed-Solomon code when the set of evaluation points is the whole finite field or the multiplicative group."
