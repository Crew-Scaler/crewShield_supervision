  "summary": "We develop a general effective field theory (EFT) framework for neutrino-dark matter (DM) interactions, and apply it to systematically find all possible gauge-invariant ultraviolet (UV) completions at a given EFT operator dimension. Our goal here is to find simple UV-complete models that can realize potentially large neutrino-DM interactions, while being consistent with all existing theoretical and experimental constraints. We first construct the leading non-derivative operator basis for neutrin"
