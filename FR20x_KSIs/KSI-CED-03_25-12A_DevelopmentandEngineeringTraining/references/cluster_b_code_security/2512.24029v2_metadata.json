  "summary": "A single service robot can present two distinct agencies: its onboard autonomy and an operator-mediated agency, yet users experience them through one physical body. We formalize this dual-agency structure as a User-Robot-Operator triad in an autonomous remote-control setting that integrates teleoperation with autonomous execution and human-in-the-loop remote assistance. Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2"
