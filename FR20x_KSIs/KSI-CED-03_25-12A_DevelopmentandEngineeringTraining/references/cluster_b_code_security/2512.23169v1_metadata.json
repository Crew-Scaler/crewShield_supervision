  "summary": "Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structu"
