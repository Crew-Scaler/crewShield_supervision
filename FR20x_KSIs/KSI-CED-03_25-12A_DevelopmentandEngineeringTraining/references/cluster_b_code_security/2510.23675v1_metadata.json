  "summary": "Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors, leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability: leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the "
