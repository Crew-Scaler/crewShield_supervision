  "summary": "We analyze regional earthquake energy statistics from the Southern California and Japan seismic catalogs and find scale-invariant energy distributions characterized by an exponent $\u03c4\\simeq 1.67$. To quantify how closely scale-invariant dynamics with different exponent values resemble real earthquakes, we generate synthetic energy distributions over a wide range of $\u03c4$ under conditions of constant activity. Earthquake-like behavior, in a broad sense, is obtained for $1.5 \\leqslant \u03c4&lt; 2.0$. Whe"
