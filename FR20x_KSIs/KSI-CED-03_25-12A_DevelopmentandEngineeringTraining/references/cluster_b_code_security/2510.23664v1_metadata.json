  "summary": "The emergence of Agentic AI is fundamentally transforming how software is designed, developed, and maintained. Traditional software development methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous learning. To address this methodological gap, we present \"Agentsway\" a novel software development framework designed for ecos"
