  "summary": "A non-autonomous discrete delayed system for a one-species chemostat based on an Ellermeyer model for the continuous case is studied. Conditions for the persistence or the extinction of the solutions are obtained respectively in terms of the lower and upper Bohl exponents for a scalar linear equation associated to the problem. Furthermore, the condition for persistence also implies the attractiveness, that is, the existence of a bounded solution that attracts all the others. As a special case, w"
