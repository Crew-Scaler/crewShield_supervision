  "summary": "As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are deployed in next-generation wireless networks, a new security vulnerability emerges, particularly in terms of sensing privacy. Unauthorized sensing eavesdroppers (Eve) can potentially exploit the ISAC signal for their own independent passive sensing. However, solutions for sensing-secure ISAC remain largely unexplored to date. This work addresses sensing-security for OFDM- and OTFS-based ISAC waveforms from a target-detection perspective"
