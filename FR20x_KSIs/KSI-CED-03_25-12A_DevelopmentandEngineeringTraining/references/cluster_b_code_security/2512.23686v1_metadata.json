  "summary": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled me"
