  "summary": "Developing space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number "
