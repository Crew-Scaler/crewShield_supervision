  "summary": "Understanding the risks associated with an enterprise environment is the first step toward improving its security. Organizations employ various methods to assess and prioritize the risks identified in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports that may be relevant to their operations. Some methodologies rely heavily on manual analysis (which requires expertise and cannot be applied frequently), while others automate the assessment, using attack graphs (AGs) or threat emulators. Such emulators can b"
