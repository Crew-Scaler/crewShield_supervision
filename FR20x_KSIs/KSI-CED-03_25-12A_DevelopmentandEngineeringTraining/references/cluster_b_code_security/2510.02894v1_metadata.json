  "summary": "PyRadiomics-cuda is a GPU-accelerated extension of the PyRadiomics library, designed to address the computational challenges of extracting three-dimensional shape features from medical images. By offloading key geometric computations to GPU hardware it dramatically reduces processing times for large volumetric datasets. The system maintains full compatibility with the original PyRadiomics API, enabling seamless integration into existing AI workflows without code modifications. This transparent a"
