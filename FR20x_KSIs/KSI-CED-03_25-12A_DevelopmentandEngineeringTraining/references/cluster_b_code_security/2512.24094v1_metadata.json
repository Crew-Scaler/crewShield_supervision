  "summary": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum physics, which inherently guarantee information-theoretic security and intrinsic resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, the secure key rate of QKD typically decreases exponentially with increasing channel distance. In this work, by developing a novel polarization-state preparation method, an ultra-low time-jitter laser source and superconducting nanowire single-photon detect"
