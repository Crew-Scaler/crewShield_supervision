  "summary": "The increasing sophistication of malware attacks in the npm ecosystem, characterized by obfuscation and complex logic, necessitates advanced detection methods. Recently, researchers have turned their attention from traditional detection approaches to Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their strong capabilities in semantic code understanding. However, while LLMs offer superior semantic reasoning for code analysis, their practical application is constrained by limited context windows and high com"
