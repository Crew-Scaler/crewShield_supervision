  "summary": "Deformable linear objects (DLOs) manipulation presents significant challenges due to DLOs' inherent high-dimensional state space and complex deformation dynamics. The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracki"
