  "summary": "Neural code models have been increasingly incorporated into software development processes. However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of bac"
