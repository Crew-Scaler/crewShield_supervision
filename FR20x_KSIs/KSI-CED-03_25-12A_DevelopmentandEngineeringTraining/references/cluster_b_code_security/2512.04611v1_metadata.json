  "summary": "Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) input generation is a critical task in software security and supports downstream applications such as path generation and validation. Generating a PoV input requires solving two sets of constraints: (1) reachability constraints for reaching vulnerable code locations, and (2) triggering constraints for activating the target vulnerability. Existing approaches, including directed greybox fuzzing and LLM-assisted fuzzing, struggle to efficiently satisfy these constraints"
