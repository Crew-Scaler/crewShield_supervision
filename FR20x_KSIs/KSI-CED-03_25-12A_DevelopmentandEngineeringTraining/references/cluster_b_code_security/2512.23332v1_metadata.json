  "summary": "Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and occur, e.g., when specifying security and information-flow properties. Checking if a hyperproperty is satisfiable has many important applications, such as testing if some security property is contradictory, or analyzing implications and equivalences between information-flow policies. In this paper, we present FOLHyper, a tool that can automatically check satisfiability of hyperproperties specified in the temporal log"
