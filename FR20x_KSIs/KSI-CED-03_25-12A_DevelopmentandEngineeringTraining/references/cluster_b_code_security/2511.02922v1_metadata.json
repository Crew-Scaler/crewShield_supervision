  "summary": "Code comprehension is essential for brownfield programming tasks, in which developers maintain and enhance legacy code bases. Generative AI (GenAI) coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot have been shown to improve developer productivity, but their impact on code understanding is less clear. We replicate and extend a previous study by exploring both performance and comprehension in GenAI-assisted brownfield programming tasks. In a within-subjects experimental study, 18 computer science graduate"
