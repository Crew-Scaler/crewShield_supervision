  "summary": "Sequential statistical protocols require meticulous state management and robust error handling -- challenges naturally suited to functional programming. We present a functional architecture for structural enforcement of statistical rigor in automated research systems (AI-Scientists). These LLM-driven systems risk generating spurious discoveries through dynamic hypothesis testing. We introduce the Research monad, a Haskell eDSL that enforces sequential statistical protocols (e.g., Online FDR (fal"
