  "summary": "Mapping water extent during a flood event is essential for effective disaster management throughout all phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In particular, during the response stage, when timely and accurate information is important, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are primarily employed to produce water extent maps. Recently, leveraging the complementary characteristics of SAR and MSI data through a multimodal approach has emerged as a promising strategy for advancing w"
