  "summary": "Classifying legal documents is a challenge, besides their specialized vocabulary, sometimes they can be very long. This means that feeding full documents to a Transformers-based models for classification might be impossible, expensive or slow. Thus, we present a legal document classifier based on DeBERTa V3 and a LSTM, that uses as input a collection of 48 randomly-selected short chunks (max 128 tokens). Besides, we present its deployment pipeline using Temporal, a durable execution solution, wh"
