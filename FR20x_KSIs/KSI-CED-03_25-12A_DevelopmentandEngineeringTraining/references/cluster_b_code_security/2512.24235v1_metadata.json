  "summary": "Automated Essay Scoring (AES) has gained increasing attention in recent years, yet research on Arabic AES remains limited due to the lack of publicly available datasets. To address this, we introduce LAILA, the largest publicly available Arabic AES dataset to date, comprising 7,859 essays annotated with holistic and trait-specific scores on seven dimensions: relevance, organization, vocabulary, style, development, mechanics, and grammar. We detail the dataset design, collection, and annotations,"
