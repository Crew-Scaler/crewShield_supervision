  "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making applications, including robotics, healthcare, smart grids, and finance. Recent studies reveal that adversaries can implant backdoors into DRL agents during the training phase. These backdoors can later be activated by specific triggers during deployment, compelling the agent to execute targeted actions and potentially leading to severe consequences, such as drone crashes or vehicle col"
