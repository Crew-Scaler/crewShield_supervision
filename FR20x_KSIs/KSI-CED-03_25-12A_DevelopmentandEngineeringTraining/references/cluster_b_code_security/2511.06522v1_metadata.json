  "summary": "Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathemati"
