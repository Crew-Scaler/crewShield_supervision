  "summary": "This paper reviews the field of extreme nonlinear optics in optical fibers, highlighting key phenomena and advancements. It discusses multiple ionization effects caused by femtosecond laser pulses that generate plasma and induce permanent material modifications, as well as plasma luminescence and its dependence on material imperfections. The formation and dynamics of plasma filaments, including helical structures, are explored, along with the rainbow spiral emission pattern useful in communicati"
