  "summary": "Generative code models (GCMs) significantly enhance development efficiency through automated code generation and code summarization. However, building and training these models require computational resources and time, necessitating effective digital copyright protection to prevent unauthorized leaks and misuse. Backdoor watermarking, by embedding hidden identifiers, simplifies copyright verification by breaking the model's black-box nature. Current backdoor watermarking techniques face two main"
