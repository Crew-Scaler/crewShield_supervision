  "summary": "Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a r"
