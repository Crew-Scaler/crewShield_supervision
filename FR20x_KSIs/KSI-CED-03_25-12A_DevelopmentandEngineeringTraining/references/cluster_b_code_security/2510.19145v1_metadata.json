  "summary": "The growing use of third-party hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) for deep neural networks (DNNs) introduces new security vulnerabilities. Conventional model-level backdoor attacks, which only poison a model's weights to misclassify inputs with a specific trigger, are often detectable because the entire attack logic is embedded within the model (i.e., software), creating a traceable layer-by-layer activation path.\n  This paper introduces the HArdware-Model Logically Combined Attack (HAML"
