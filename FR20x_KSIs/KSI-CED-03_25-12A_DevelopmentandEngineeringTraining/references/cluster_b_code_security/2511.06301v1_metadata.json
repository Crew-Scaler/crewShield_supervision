  "summary": "Evaluating semantic tables interpretation (STI) systems, (particularly, those based on Large Language Models- LLMs) especially in domain-specific contexts such as the security domain, depends heavily on the dataset. However, in the security domain, tabular datasets for state-of-the-art are not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce Secu-Table dataset, composed of more than 1500 tables with more than 15k entities constructed using security data extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and E"
