  "summary": "Conformal prediction (CP) is widely presented as distribution-free predictive inference with finite-sample marginal coverage under exchangeability. We argue that CP is best understood as a rank-calibrated descendant of the Fisher-Dempster-Hill fiducial/direct-probability tradition rather than as Bayesian conditioning in disguise.\n  We establish four separations from coherent countably additive predictive semantics. First, canonical conformal constructions violate conditional extensionality: pred"
