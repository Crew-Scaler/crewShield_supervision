  "summary": "SPHINCS+ is a stateless hash-based signature scheme that provides strong post quantum security, but its signature generation is slow due to intensive hash computations. GPUs offer massive parallelism that can potentially accelerate SPHINCS+ signatures. However, existing GPU-based optimizations either fail to fully exploit the inherent parallelism of SPHINCS+'s Merkle tree structure or lack fine-grained, compiler-level customization across its diverse computational kernels. This paper proposes HE"
