  "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly central to modern speech-driven applications, but performance degrades under acoustic shift - real-world noise, reverberation, and microphone variation. Prior solutions rely on offline domain adaptation, which is post-hoc, data-intensive, and slow. We introduce the first test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for generative SLMs that process interleaved audio-text prompts. Our method updates a small, targeted subset of parameters during inference usin"
