  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, largely driven by the availability of high-quality code datasets for effective training. To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwis"
