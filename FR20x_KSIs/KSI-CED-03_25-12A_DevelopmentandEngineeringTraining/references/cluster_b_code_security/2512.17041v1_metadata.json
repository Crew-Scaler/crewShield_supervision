  "summary": "Agentic AI is increasingly being explored and introduced in both manually driven and autonomous vehicles, leading to the notion of Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), with capabilities such as memory-based personalization, goal interpretation, strategic reasoning, and tool-mediated assistance. While frameworks such as the OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks highlight vulnerabilities in reasoning-driven AI systems, they are not designed for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms such as vehicles, nor do they "
