  "summary": "In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs lea"
