  "summary": "RS Oph is a recurrent nova, a kind of cataclismic variable that shows bursts in a period approximately shorter than a century. Persistent homology, a technique from topological data analysis, studies the evolution of topological features of a simplicial complex composed of the data points or an embedding of them, as some distance parameter is varied. For this work I trained a supervised learning model based on several featurizations, namely persistence landscapes, Carlsson coordinates, persisten"
