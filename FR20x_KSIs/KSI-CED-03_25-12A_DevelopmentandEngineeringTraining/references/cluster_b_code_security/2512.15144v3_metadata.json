  "summary": "Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to interact with external tools, yet empirical research on MCP is hindered by the lack of large-scale, accessible datasets. We present MCPZoo, the largest and most comprehensive dataset of MCP servers collected from multiple public sources, comprising 129,059 servers (56,053 distinct). MCPZoo includes 16,356 server instances that have been deployed and verified as runnable and interactable, supporting realistic experimentation beyond static analysis. T"
