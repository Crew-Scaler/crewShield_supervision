  "summary": "Despite being under intense scrutiny for 50 years, the Kuramoto oscillator model has remained a quintessential representative of non-equilibrium phase transitions. One of the reasons for its enduring relevance is the apparent lack of an optimization formulation, due to the fact that (superficially), the equations of motion seem to not be compatible with a Lagrangian structure. We show that, as a mean-field classical (twisted) spin model on $S^2$, the Kuramoto model can be described variationaly."
