  "summary": "The FKDM $k$-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus, targeting modeling scenarios where the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates efficient parameterizations (e.g. climate modeling). Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo method for radiative transfer is built into the $k$-distribution terms construction process, explicitly controlling accuracy.
