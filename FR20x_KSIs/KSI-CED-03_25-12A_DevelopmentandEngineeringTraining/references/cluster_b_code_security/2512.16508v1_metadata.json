  "summary": "The development of PET and positronium imaging techniques is strictly related to the availability of suitable radionuclides and robust radiochemistry platforms. Among the emerging candidates, $^{44}$Sc has attracted significant interest due to its favourable physical properties, including a half-life of $\\sim$4 hours, a pure $\u03b2^{+}$ emission profile, and the additional prompt $\u03b3$-emission that enables advanced triple-photon detection schemes. These characteristics make $^{44}$Sc particularly pro"
