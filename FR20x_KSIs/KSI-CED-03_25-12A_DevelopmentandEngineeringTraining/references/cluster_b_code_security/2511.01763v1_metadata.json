  "summary": "Binary decompilation plays an important role in software security analysis, reverse engineering, and malware understanding when source code is unavailable. However, existing decompilation techniques often fail to produce source code that can be successfully recompiled and re-executed, particularly for optimized binaries. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled neural approaches to decompilation, but the generated code is typically only semantically plausible rather than trul"
