  "summary": "This study describes the development of an AI-assisted error analysis system designed to identify, categorize, and correct writing errors in English. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1, the system employs a detailed taxonomy grounded in linguistic theories from Corder (1967), Richards (1971), and James (1998). Errors are classified at both word and sentence levels, covering spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Implemented through Python-coded API calls, "
