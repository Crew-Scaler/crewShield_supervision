  "summary": "Watermarking is a technique to help identify the source of data points, which can be used to help prevent the misuse of protected datasets. Existing methods on code watermarking, leveraging the idea from the backdoor research, embed stealthy triggers as watermarks. Despite their high resilience against dilution attacks and backdoor detections, the robustness has not been fully evaluated. To fill this gap, we propose DeCoMa, a dual-channel approach to Detect and purify Code dataset waterMarks. To"
