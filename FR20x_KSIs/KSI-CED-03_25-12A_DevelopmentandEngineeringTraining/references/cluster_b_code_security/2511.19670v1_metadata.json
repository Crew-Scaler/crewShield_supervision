  "summary": "Cyber-Physical Systems have played an essential role in our daily lives, providing critical services such as power and water, whose operability, availability, and reliability must be ensured. The C programming language, prevalent in CPS development, is crucial for system control where reliability is critical. However, it is also commonly susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly buffer overflows. Traditional vulnerability discovery techniques often struggle with scalability and precision when"
