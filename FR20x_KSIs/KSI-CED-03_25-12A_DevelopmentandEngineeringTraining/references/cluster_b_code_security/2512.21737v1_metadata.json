  "summary": "This paper demonstrates a power analysis-based Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) attack on the SNOW-V encryption algorithm, which is a 5G mobile communication security standard candidate. Implemented on an STM32 microcontroller, power traces captured with a ChipWhisperer board were analyzed, with Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) confirming exploitable leakage. Profiling attacks using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCN) achieved efficient key recovery, with"
