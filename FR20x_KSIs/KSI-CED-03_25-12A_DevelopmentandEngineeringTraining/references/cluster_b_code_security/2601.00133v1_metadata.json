  "summary": "Foundation models (FMs) have recently shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities across diverse scientific domains. In this work, we introduce a unified in-context learning foundation model (ICL-FM) framework for materials property prediction that integrates both composition-based and structure-aware representations. The proposed approach couples the pretrained TabPFN transformer with graph neural network (GNN)-derived embeddings and our novel MagpieEX descriptors. MagpieEX augments"
