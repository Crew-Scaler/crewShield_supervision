  "summary": "We present a comprehensive analysis of four young open clusters, NGC 663, NGC 2301, NGC 2384, and NGC 7510, utilizing high-precision astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3. Cluster membership was determined using the UPMASK algorithm, resulting in probable member counts ranging from 337 to 1498 across the clusters. Bayesian MCMC isochrone fitting yielded cluster ages in the range $\\log t \\sim 7.0$ -$8.15$, with uncertainties of $\\sim 0.11$-$0.18$. Reddening values ranged from $E(B-V)=0.0"
