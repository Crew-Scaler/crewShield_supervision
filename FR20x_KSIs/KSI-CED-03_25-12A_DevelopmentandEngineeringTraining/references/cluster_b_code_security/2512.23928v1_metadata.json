  "summary": "A 1995 SIGCOMM paper, \"A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and Application-Level Framing\", commonly known as SRM, explored a fundamentally new approach to reliable multiparty data delivery. Rather than adapting established sender-driven reliable unicast mechanisms to multicast, as most contemporaneous proposals did, SRM introduced a data-centric model in which data receivers recover losses by explicitly requesting missing data. Thirty years later, we revisit the SRM framewor"
