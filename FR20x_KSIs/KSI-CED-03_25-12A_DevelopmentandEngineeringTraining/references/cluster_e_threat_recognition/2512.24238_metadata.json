  "summary": "Many location-based services rely on a point-in-polygon test (PiP), checking whether a point or a trajectory lies inside a geographic zone. Since geometric operations are expensive in zero-knowledge proofs, privately performing the PiP test is challenging. In this paper, we answer the research quest"
