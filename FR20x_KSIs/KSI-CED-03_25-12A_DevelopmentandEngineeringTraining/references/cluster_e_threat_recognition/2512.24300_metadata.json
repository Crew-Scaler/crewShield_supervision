  "summary": "Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative vide"
