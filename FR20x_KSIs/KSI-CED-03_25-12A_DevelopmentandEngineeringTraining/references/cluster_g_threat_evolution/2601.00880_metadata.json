  "summary": "We present Universal Conditional Logic (UCL), a mathematical framework for prompt optimization that transforms prompt engineering from heuristic practice into systematic optimization. Through systematic evaluation (N=305, 11 models, 4 iterations), we demonstrate significant token reduction (29.8%, t"
