  "summary": "This paper presents a novel extension to the existing Multi-Agent Interoperability specifications of the Open Voice Interoperability Initiative (originally also known as OVON from the Open Voice Network). This extension enables AI agents developed with different technologies to communicate using a universal, natural language-based API or NLP-based standard APIs. Focusing on the management of multiparty AI conversations, this work introduces new concepts such as the Convener Agent, Floor-Shared C"
