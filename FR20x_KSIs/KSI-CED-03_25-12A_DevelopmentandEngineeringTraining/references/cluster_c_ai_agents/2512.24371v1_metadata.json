  "summary": "We consider an agent who has access to a financial market, including derivative contracts, who looks to maximise her utility. Whilst the agent looks to maximise utility over one probability measure, or class of probability measures, she must also ensure that the mark-to-market value of her portfolio remains above a given threshold. When the mark-to-market value is based on a more pessimistic valuation method, such as model-independent bounds, we recover a novel optimisation problem for the agent"
