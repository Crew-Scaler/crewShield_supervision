  "summary": "This paper investigates the problem of resilient control for multi-agent systems in the presence of Byzantine adversaries via an active secure neighbor selection framework. A pre-discriminative graph is first constructed to characterize the admissible set of candidate neighbors for each agent. Based on this graph, a dynamic in-neighbor selection strategy is proposed, wherein each agent actively selects a subset of its pre-discriminative neighbors. The number of selected neighbors is adjustable, "
