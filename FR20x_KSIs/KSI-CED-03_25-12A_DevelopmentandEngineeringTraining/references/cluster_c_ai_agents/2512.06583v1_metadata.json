  "summary": "Tournament-based compensation schemes with forced distributions represent a widely adopted class of relative performance evaluation mechanisms in technology and corporate environments. These systems mandate within-team ranking and fixed distributional requirements (e.g., bottom 15% terminated, top 15% promoted), ostensibly to resolve principal-agent problems through mandatory differentiation. We demonstrate through agent-based simulation that this mechanism produces systematic classification err"
