  "summary": "Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $\u03c4$) is known a priori. When $\u03c4$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $\u03c4$ with the reward parameters ($\u03b8$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $\u03b8$ and $\u03c4$ from obs"
