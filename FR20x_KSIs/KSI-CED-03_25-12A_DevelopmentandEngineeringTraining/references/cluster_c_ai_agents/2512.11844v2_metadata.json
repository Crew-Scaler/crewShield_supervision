  "summary": "We propose Love First, Know Later: a paradigm shift in computational matching that simulates interactions first, then assesses compatibility. Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals "
