  "summary": "Agentic AI systems are emerging as powerful tools for automating complex, multi-step tasks across various industries. One such industry is telecommunications, where the growing complexity of next-generation radio access networks (RANs) opens up numerous opportunities for applying these systems. Securing the RAN is a key area, particularly through automating the security compliance process, as traditional methods often struggle to keep pace with evolving specifications and real-time changes.
