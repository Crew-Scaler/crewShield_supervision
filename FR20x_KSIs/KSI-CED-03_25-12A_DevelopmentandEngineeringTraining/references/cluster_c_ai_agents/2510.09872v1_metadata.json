  "summary": "Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to master $\\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages u"
