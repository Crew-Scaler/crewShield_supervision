  "summary": "Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges, from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets. In the proposed architecture, autonom"
