  "summary": "Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, an"
