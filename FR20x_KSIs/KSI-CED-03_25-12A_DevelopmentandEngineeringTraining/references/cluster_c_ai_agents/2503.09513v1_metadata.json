  "summary": "Internet of Things (IoT) platforms with trigger-action capability allow event conditions to trigger actions in IoT devices autonomously by creating a chain of interactions. Adversaries exploit this chain of interactions to maliciously inject fake event conditions into IoT hubs, triggering unauthorized actions on target IoT devices to implement remote injection attacks. Existing defense mechanisms focus mainly on the verification of event transactions using physical event fingerprints to enforce "
