  "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and replicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new methodologies being developed to address long"
