  "summary": "Large language models enable flexible multi-agent planning but remain fragile in practice: verification is often circular, state changes are not tracked for repair, and small faults trigger costly global recomputation. We present ALAS, a stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from non-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks and restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in progress. The validator operates independent"
