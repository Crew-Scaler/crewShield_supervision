  "summary": "Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical, especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for coordination being analyzed in isolation.
