  "summary": "Implications of the advancements in the area of artificial intelligence to the wireless communications is extremely significant, especially in terms of resource management. In this paper, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered Large Language Model (ReLLM)-driven dynamic radio resource management framework for Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) inspired 6G networks is proposed. The introduced methodology leverages the ReLLM framework to interpret both historical and real-time network dat"
