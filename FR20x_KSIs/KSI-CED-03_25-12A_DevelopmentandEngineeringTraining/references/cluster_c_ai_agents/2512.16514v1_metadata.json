  "summary": "A central challenge in blockchain tokenomics is aligning short-term performance incentives with long-term decentralization goals. We propose a framework for algorithmic monetary policies that navigates this tradeoff in repeated participation games. Agents, characterized by type (capability) and stake, choose to participate or abstain at each round; the policy (probabilistically) selects high-type agents for task execution (maximizing throughput) while distributing rewards to sustain decentraliza"
