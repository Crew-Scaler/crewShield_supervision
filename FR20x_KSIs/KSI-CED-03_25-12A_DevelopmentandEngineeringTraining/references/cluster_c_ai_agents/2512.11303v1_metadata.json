  "summary": "Large Language Model agents face fundamental challenges in adapting to novel tasks due to limitations in tool availability and experience reuse. Existing approaches either rely on predefined tools with limited coverage or build tools from scratch without leveraging past experiences, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal performance. We introduce SMITH (Shared Memory Integrated Tool Hub), a unified cognitive architecture that seamlessly integrates dynamic tool creation with cross-task"
