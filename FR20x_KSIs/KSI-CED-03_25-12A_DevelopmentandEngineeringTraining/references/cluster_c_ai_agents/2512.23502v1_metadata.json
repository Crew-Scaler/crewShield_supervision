  "summary": "Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language under"
