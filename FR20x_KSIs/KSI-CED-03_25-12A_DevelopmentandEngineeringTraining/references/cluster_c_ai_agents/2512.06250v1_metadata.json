  "summary": "Autonomous agents often require multiple strategies to solve complex tasks, but determining when to switch between strategies remains challenging. This research introduces a reinforcement learning technique to learn switching thresholds between two orthogonal navigation policies. Using maze navigation as a case study, this work demonstrates how an agent can dynamically transition between systematic exploration (coverage) and goal-directed pathfinding (convergence) to improve task performance.
