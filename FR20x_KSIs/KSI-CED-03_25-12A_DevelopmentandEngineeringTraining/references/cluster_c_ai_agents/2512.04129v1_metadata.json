  "summary": "LLM-based multi-agent systems (MASs) have reshaped the digital landscape with their emergent coordination and problem-solving capabilities. However, current security evaluations of MASs are still confined to limited attack scenarios, leaving their security issues unclear and likely underestimated. To fill this gap, we propose TOMA, a topology-aware multi-hop attack scheme targeting MASs. By optimizing the propagation of contamination within the MAS topology and controlling the multi-hop diffusio"
