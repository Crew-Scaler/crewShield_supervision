  "summary": "In many natural and engineered systems, agents interact through local contests that determine which individuals become dominant within their neighborhoods. These interactions are shaped by inherent differences in strength, and they often lead to stable dominance patterns that emerge surprisingly quickly relative to the size of the population. This motivates the search for simple mathematical models that capture both heterogeneous agent strength and rapid convergence to stable local dominance.\n  "
