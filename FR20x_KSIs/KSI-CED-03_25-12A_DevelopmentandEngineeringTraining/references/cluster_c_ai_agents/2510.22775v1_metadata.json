  "summary": "While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks, the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents v"
