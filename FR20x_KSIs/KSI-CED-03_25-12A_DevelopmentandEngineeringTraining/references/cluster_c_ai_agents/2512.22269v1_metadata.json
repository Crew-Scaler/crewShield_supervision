  "summary": "Reducing the formation temperature of single-phase multioxides is one of the classic challenges in ceramic processing, including wet-chemical synthesis routes. Toward pursuing this aim for diopside (MgCaSi2O6), the merit of different sol-gel and coprecipitation processes using the related chloride precursors followed by calcination was compared from the viewpoints of crystallinity and homogeneity. In accordance to the results, the use of the sol-gel techniques, directed with/without an alkaline "
