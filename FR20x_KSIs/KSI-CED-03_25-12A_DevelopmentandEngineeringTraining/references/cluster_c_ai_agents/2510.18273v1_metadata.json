  "summary": "Distributed resource allocation (DRA) is fundamental to modern networked systems, spanning applications from economic dispatch in smart grids to CPU scheduling in data centers. Conventional DRA approaches require reliable communication, yet real-world networks frequently suffer from link failures, packet drops, and communication delays due to environmental conditions, network congestion, and security threats.\n  We introduce a novel resilient DRA algorithm that addresses these critical challenges"
