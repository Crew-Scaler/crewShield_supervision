  "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have renewed focus on the design of reward functions that shape agent behavior. Manually designing reward functions is tedious and error-prone. A principled alternative is to specify behaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into rewards. Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given their established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing methods using omega-regular specificatio"
