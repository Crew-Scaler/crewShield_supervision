  "summary": "Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities, resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise or inadequate protection. To address th"
