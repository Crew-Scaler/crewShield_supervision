  "summary": "Anti-malware systems rely on sandboxes, hooks, and telemetry pipelines, including collection agents, serializers, and database backends, to monitor program and system behavior. We show that these data-handling components constitute an exploitable attack surface that can lead to denial-of-analysis (DoA) states without disabling sensors or requiring elevated privileges. As a result, we present Telemetry Complexity Attacks (TCAs), a new class of vulnerabilities that exploit fundamental mismatches b"
