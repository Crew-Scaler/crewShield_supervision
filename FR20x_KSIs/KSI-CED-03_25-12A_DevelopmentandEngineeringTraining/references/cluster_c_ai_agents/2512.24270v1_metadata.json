  "summary": "Socio-economic networks, from cities and firms to collaborative projects, often appear resilient for long periods before experiencing rapid, cascading decline as participation erodes. We explain such dynamics through a framework of strategic network abandonment, in which interconnected agents choose activity levels in a network game and remain active only if participation yields higher utility than an improving outside option. As outside opportunities rise, agents exit endogenously, triggering e"
