  "summary": "The integration of vision-language models (VLMs) is driving a new generation of embodied agents capable of operating in human-centered environments. However, as deployment expands, these systems face growing safety risks, particularly when executing hazardous instructions. Current safety evaluation benchmarks remain limited: they cover only narrow scopes of hazards and focus primarily on final outcomes, neglecting the agent's full perception-planning-execution process and thereby obscuring criti"
