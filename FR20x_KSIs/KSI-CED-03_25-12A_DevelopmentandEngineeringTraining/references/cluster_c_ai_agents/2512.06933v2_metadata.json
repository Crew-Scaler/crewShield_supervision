  "summary": "Understanding the economic intent of Ethereum transactions is critical for user safety, yet current tools expose only raw on-chain data, leading to widespread \"blind signing\" (approving transactions without understanding them). Through interviews with 16 Web3 users, we find that effective explanations should be structured, risk-aware, and grounded at the token-flow level.\n  Based on interviews, we propose TxSum, a new task and dataset of 100 complex Ethereum transactions annotated with natural-l"
