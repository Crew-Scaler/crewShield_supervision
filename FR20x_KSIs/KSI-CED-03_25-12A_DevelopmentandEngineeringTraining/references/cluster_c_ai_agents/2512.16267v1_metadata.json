  "summary": "In biological systems, active agents such as actomyosin and cells move and interact on curved surfaces, exhibiting diverse phenomena. These observations have motivated studies of how curvature shapes their collective behavior. Here, using a geometric framework, a minimal model is presented for interacting active agents on curved surfaces with Vicsek-like polar alignment. A transition between disordered and ordered states occurs on spheres as well as on oblate and prolate spheroids. As the deviat"
