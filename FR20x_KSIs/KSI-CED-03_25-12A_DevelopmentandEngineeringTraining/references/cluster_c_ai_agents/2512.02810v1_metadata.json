  "summary": "Multi-robot task allocation in construction automation has traditionally relied on optimization methods such as Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they lar"
