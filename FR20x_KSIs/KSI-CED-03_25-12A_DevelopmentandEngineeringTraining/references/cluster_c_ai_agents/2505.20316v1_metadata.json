  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in ranking systems such as information retrieval (IR) systems and recommender systems (RSs). To alleviate the latency of auto-regressive decoding, some studies explore the single (first) token decoding for ranking approximation, but they suffer from severe degradation in tail positions. Although speculative decoding (SD) methods can be a remedy with verification at different positions, they face challenges in ranking systems due to their left"
