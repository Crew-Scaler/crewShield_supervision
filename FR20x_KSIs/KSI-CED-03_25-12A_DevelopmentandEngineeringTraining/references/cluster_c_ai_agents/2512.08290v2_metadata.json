  "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as the de facto standard for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to external data and tools, effectively functioning as the \"USB-C for Agentic AI.\" While this decoupling of context and execution solves critical interoperability challenges, it introduces a profound new threat landscape where the boundary between epistemic errors (hallucinations) and security breaches (unauthorized actions) dissolves. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) aims to "
