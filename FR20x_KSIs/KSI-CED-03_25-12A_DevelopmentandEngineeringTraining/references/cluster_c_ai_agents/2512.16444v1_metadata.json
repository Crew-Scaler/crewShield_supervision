  "summary": "Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraf"
