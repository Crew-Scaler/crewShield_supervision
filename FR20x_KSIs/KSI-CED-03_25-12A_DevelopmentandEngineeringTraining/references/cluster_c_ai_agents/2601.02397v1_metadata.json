  "summary": "Dynamic nonzero sum games are widely used to model multi agent decision making in control, economics, and related fields. Classical methods for computing Nash equilibria, especially in linear quadratic settings, rely on strong structural assumptions and become impractical for nonlinear dynamics, many players, or long horizons, where multiple local equilibria may exist. We show through examples that such methods can fail to reach the true global Nash equilibrium even in relatively small games. To"
