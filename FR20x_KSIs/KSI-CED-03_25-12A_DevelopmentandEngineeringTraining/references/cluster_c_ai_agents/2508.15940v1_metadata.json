  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory. To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system designed specifically for digital ASIC design"
