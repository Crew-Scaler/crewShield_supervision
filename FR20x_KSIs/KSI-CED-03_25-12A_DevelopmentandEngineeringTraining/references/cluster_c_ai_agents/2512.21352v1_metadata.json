  "summary": "Manual software beta testing is costly and time-consuming, while single-agent large language model (LLM) approaches suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent behavior. We propose a multi-agent committee framework in which diverse vision-enabled LLMs collaborate through a three-round voting protocol to reach consensus on testing actions. The framework combines model diversity, persona-driven behavioral variation, and visual user interface understanding to systematically explore web applications"
