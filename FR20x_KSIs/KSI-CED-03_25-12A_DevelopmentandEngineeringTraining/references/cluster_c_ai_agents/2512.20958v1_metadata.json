  "summary": "De novo drug design is a crucial component of modern drug development, yet navigating the vast chemical space to find synthetically accessible, high-affinity candidates remains a significant challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design "
