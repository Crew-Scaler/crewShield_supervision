  "summary": "This paper investigates the output synchronization problem for discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to distinct communication delays. The presence of such delays prevents the instantaneous delivery of information from neighboring nodes, thereby severely degrading the performance of standard distributed control schemes. To overcome this, we propose a prediction-based framework for exact delay compensation. Specifically, we introduce predictors combined with a mechanism o"
