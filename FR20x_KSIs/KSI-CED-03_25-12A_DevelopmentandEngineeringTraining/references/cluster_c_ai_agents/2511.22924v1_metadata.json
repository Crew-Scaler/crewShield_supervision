  "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer powerful cooperative reasoning but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where compromised agents can undermine the system's overall performance. Existing defenses either depend on single trusted auditors, creating single points of failure, or sacrifice efficiency for robustness. To resolve this tension, we propose \\textbf{AgentShield}, a distributed framework for efficient, decentralized auditing. AgentShield introduces a nove"
