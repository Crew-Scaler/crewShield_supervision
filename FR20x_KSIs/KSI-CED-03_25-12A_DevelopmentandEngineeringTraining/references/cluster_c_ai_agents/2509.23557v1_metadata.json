  "summary": "This paper presents SIMPOL (Simplified Policy Iteration), a modular numerical framework for solving continuous-time heterogeneous agent models. The core economic problem, the optimization of consumption and savings under idiosyncratic uncertainty, is formulated as a coupled system of partial differential equations: a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the agent's optimal policy and a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation for the stationary wealth distribution. SIMPOL addresses this sys"
