  "summary": "Cybersecurity has become one of the earliest adopters of agentic AI, as security operations centers increasingly rely on multi-step reasoning, tool-driven analysis, and rapid decision-making under pressure. While individual large language models can summarize alerts or interpret unstructured reports, they fall short in real SOC environments that require grounded data access, reproducibility, and accountable workflows. In response, the field has seen a rapid architectural evolution from single-mo"
