  "summary": "This study introduces GreenIQ, an AI-powered deep search platform designed to revolutionise carbon market intelligence through autonomous analysis and automated report generation. Carbon markets operate across diverse regulatory landscapes, generating vast amounts of heterogeneous data from policy documents, industry reports, academic literature, and real-time trading platforms. Traditional research approaches remain labour-intensive, slow, and difficult to scale. GreenIQ addresses these limitat"
