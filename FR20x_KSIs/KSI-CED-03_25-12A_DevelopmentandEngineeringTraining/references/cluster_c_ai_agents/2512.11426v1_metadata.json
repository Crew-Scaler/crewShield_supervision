  "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are becoming indispensable building blocks for web-scale applications such as web search, social network analytics, and online customer support, where cost-effectiveness is increasingly the primary constraint for large-scale deployment. While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budget"
