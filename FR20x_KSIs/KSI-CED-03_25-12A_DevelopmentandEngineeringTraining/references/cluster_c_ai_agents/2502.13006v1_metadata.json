  "summary": "Automated Planning algorithms require a model of the domain that specifies the preconditions and effects of each action. Obtaining such a domain model is notoriously hard. Algorithms for learning domain models exist, yet it remains unclear whether learning a domain model and planning is an effective approach for numeric planning environments, i.e., where states include discrete and numeric state variables. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning a numeric domain model and compare it wi"
