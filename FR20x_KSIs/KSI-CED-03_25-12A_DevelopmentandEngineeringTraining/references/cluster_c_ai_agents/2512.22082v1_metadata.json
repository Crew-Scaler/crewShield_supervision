  "summary": "Research on online social networks (OSNs) is often hindered by platform opacity, limited access to data, and ethical constraints. Simulation offer a valuable alternative, but existing frameworks frequently lack realism and explainability. This paper presents a simulation framework that models synthetic social networks with agents endowed with demographic-based personality traits and finite-state behavioral automata, enabling realistic and interpretable actions. A generative module powered by a l"
