  "summary": "This paper presents a distributed beamforming framework for a constellation of airborne platform stations (APSs) in a massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) non-terrestrial network (NTN) that targets the downlink sum-rate maximization under imperfect local channel state information (CSI). We propose a novel entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach where each non-terrestrial base station (NTBS) independently computes its beamforming vector using a Fourier Ne"
