  "summary": "We analyze how uncertain technologies should be robustly regulated and how regulation should evolve with new information. An adaptive sandbox comprising a zero marginal tax up to an evolving quantity limit is (i) robust: it delivers optimal payoff guarantees when the agent's learning process and/or preferences are chosen adversarially; (ii) dominant: it outperforms other robust and regular mechanisms across all agent learning processes and preferences; (iii) time-consistent: it is the only robus"
