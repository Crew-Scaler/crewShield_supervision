  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in complex knowledge work, yet linear transcript interfaces limit support for reflection. Schon's Reflective Practice distinguishes between reflection-in-action (during a task) and reflection-on-action (after a task), both benefiting from non-linear, revisitable representations of dialogue. ChatGraPhT is an interactive tool that shows dialogue as a visual map, allowing users to branch and merge ideas, edit past messages, and receive guidance tha"
