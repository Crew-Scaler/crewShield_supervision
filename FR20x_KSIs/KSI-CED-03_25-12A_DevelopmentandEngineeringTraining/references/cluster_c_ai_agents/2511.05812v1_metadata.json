  "summary": "We consider a scenario where a team of two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pursue an evader UAV within an urban environment. Each agent has a limited view of their environment where buildings can occlude their field-of-view. Additionally, the pursuer team is agnostic about the evader in terms of its initial and final location, and the behavior of the evader. Consequently, the team needs to gather information by searching the environment and then track it to eventually intercept. To solve this mu"
