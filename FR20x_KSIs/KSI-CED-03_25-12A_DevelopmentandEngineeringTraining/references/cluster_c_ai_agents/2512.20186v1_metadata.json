  "summary": "Multipath TCP is widely adopted to enhance connection quality-of-service by leveraging multiple network pathways on modern devices. However, the evolution of its core congestion control is hindered by the OS kernel, whose monolithic design imposes high development overhead and lacks the resource flexibility required for data-driven methods. Furthermore, inherent noise in network statistics induces a partial observability problem, which can mislead data-driven methods like Deep Reinforcement Lear"
