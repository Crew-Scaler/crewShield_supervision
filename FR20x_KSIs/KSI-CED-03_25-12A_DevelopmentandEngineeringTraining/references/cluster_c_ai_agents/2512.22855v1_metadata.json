  "summary": "Consistent glacier boundary delineation is essential for monitoring glacier change, yet many existing approaches are difficult to scale across long time series and heterogeneous environments. In this report, we present a GeoSAM-based, semi-automatic workflow for rapid glacier delineation from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery. The method combines late-summer image compositing, spectral-index-based identification of candidate ice areas, prompt-guided segmentation using GeoSAM, and physically"
