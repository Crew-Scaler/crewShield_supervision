  "summary": "Identifying the leader within a robotic swarm is crucial, especially in adversarial contexts where leader concealment is necessary for mission success. This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Pr"
