  "summary": "We consider the design of mixing matrices to minimize the operation cost for decentralized federated learning (DFL) in wireless networks, with focus on minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption. As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-no"
