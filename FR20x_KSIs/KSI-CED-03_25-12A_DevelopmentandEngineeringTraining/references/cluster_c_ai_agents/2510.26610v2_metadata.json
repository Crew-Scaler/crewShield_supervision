  "summary": "Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to transmit only task-relevant information, thereby improving communication efficiency but also exposing semantic information to potential eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by e"
