  "summary": "Generative AI (GenAI) has reshaped software system design by introducing foundation models as pre-trained subsystems that redefine architectures and operations. The emerging challenge is no longer model fine-tuning but context engineering-how systems capture, structure, and govern external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input to enable trustworthy reasoning. Existing practices such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration remain fragmented, producing"
