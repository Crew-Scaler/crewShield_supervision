  "summary": "The future of UAV interaction systems is evolving from engineer-driven to user-driven, aiming to replace traditional predefined Human-UAV Interaction designs. This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and "
