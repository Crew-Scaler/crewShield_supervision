  "summary": "Efficiently solving large-scale optimal power flow (OPF) problems is challenging due to the high dimensionality and interconnectivity of modern power systems. Decomposition methods offer a promising solution via partitioning large problems into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, often with local information. These approaches reduce computational burden and improve flexibility by allowing agents to manage their local models. This article introduces a decomposition method that ena"
