  "summary": "The advancements in cloud-based Large Languages Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI-assisted programming. However, their integration into certain local development environments like ones within the Apple software ecosystem (e.g., iOS apps, macOS) remains challenging due to computational demands and sandboxed constraints. This paper presents CAMP, a multi-model AI-assisted programming framework that consists of a local model that employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve contextua"
