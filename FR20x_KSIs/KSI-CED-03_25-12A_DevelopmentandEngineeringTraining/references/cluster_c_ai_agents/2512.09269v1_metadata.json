  "summary": "Inferring the eventual goal of a mobile agent from noisy observations of its trajectory is a fundamental estimation problem. We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substru"
