  "summary": "Hybrid AI-HPC workflows combine large-scale simulation, training, high-throughput inference, and tightly coupled, agent-driven control within a single execution campaign. These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications "
