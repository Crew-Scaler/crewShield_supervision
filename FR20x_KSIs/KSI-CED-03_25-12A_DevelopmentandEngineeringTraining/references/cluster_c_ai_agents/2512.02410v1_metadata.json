  "summary": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly accelerating the development of autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS), paving the way for the Internet of Agents. However, traditional centralized MAS architectures present significant challenges, including single points of failure, vulnerability to censorship, inherent scalability limitations, and critical trust issues. We propose a novel Decentralized Multi-Agent System (DMAS) architecture designed to overcome these fundamental problems b"
