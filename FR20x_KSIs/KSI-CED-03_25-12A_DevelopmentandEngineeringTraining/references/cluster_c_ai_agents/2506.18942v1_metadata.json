  "summary": "This article demonstrates the transformative impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on actuarial science, illustrated by four implemented case studies. It begins with a historical overview of AI, tracing its evolution from early neural networks to modern GenAI technologies. The first case study shows how Large Language Models (LLMs) improve claims cost prediction by deriving significant features from unstructured textual data, significantly reducing prediction errors in the underlying machine learning "
