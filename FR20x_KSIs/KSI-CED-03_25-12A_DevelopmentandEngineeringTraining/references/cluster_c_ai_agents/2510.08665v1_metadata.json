  "summary": "Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This framework is a multi-agent system designed to "
