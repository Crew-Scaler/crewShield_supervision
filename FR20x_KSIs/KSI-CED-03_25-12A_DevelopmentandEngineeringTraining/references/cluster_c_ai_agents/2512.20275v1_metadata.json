  "summary": "As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning wi"
