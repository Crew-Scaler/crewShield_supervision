  "summary": "Surgical interventions, particularly in neurology, represent complex and high-stakes scenarios that impose substantial cognitive burdens on surgical teams. Although deliberate education and practice can enhance cognitive capabilities, surgical training opportunities remain limited due to patient safety concerns. To address these cognitive challenges in surgical training and operation, we propose SurgBox, an agent-driven sandbox framework to systematically enhance the cognitive capabilities of su"
