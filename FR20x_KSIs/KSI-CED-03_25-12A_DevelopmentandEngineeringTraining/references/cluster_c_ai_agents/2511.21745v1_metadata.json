  "summary": "Our paper introduces a generative, multiagent AI framework designed to overcome the rigidity, limited flexibility and technical barriers of current bibliometric tools. The objective is to enable researchers to perform fully dynamic, code-based scientometric analysis using natural language NL instructions, eliminating the need for specialized programming skills while expanding analytical depth. Methodologically, the system integrates four coordinated AI agents: a custom analytics generator, a ful"
