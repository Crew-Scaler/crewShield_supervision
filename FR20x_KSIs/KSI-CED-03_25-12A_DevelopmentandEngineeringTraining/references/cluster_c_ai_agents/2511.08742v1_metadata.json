  "summary": "Bridging the gap between individual agent behavior and macroscopic societal patterns is a central challenge in the social sciences. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via a kinetic theory formulation. We demonstrate that complex, empirically-observed phenomena, such as the concentration of populations in cities and the emergence of power-law wealth distributions, can be derived directly from a microscopic model of agents governed by underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our multi-scale"
