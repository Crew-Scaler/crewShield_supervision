  "summary": "Swarmalators are active agents that move in position space and exhibit internal degrees of freedom. Due to interactions of their positions and phases of oscillation, they show on the one hand swarming, similar to the effect of flocking of birds. In addition, they exhibit synchronization behavior, analogous to what has been observed in fireflies. Previous works studied scenarios in which the phases are forced externally. Here, we consider a pseudo-force that acts on the positions of the swarmalat"
