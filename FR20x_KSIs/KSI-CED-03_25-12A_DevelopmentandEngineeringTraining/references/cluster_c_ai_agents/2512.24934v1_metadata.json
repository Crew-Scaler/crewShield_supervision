  "summary": "We study the problem of fair $k$-committee selection under an egalitarian objective. Given $n$ agents partitioned into $m$ groups (\\eg, demographic quotas), the goal is to aggregate their preferences to form a committee of size $k$ that guarantees minimum representation from each group while minimizing the maximum \\emph{cost} incurred by any agent. We model this setting as the ordinal fair $k$-center problem, where agents are embedded in an unknown metric space, and each agent reports a complete"
