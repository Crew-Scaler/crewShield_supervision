  "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a novel framework using inhomogeneous Branching Random Walks (BRWs) to model growth processes, specifically introducing genealogy-dependence in branching rates and displacement distributions to model phenomena like bacterial colony growth. Current stochastic models often either assume independent and identical behavior of individual agents or incorporate only spatiotemporal inhomogeneity, ignoring the effect of genealogy-based inhomogeneity on the long-time behavior o"
