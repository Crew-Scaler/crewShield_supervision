  "summary": "The growing scale, complexity, interconnectivity, and autonomy of modern software ecosystems introduce unprecedented uncertainty, challenging the foundations of traditional self-adaptation. Existing approaches, typically rule-driven controllers or isolated learning components, struggle to generalize to novel contexts or coordinate responses across distributed subsystems, leaving them ill-equipped for emergent unknown unknowns. Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partners"
