  "summary": "Recent research has shown the potential of Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) to enhance energy efficiency of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. However, existing methods rely on black-box thermal dynamics models and stochastic optimizers, lacking reliability guarantees and posing risks to occupant health. In this work, we overcome the reliability bottleneck by redesigning HVAC controllers using decision trees extracted from existing thermal dynamics models and his"
