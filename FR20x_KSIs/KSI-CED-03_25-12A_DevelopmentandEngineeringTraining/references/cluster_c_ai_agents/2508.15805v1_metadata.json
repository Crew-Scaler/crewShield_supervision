  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web (with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tu"
