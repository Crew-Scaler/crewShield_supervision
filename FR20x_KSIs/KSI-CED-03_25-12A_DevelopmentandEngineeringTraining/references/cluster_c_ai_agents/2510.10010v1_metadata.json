  "summary": "We present SLEAN (Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network), a deterministic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through text-based prompt orchestration. Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code s"
