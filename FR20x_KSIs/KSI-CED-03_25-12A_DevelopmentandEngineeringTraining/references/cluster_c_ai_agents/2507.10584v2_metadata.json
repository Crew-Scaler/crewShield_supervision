  "summary": "Policy as Code (PaC) is a paradigm that encodes security and compliance policies into machine-readable formats, enabling automated enforcement in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments. However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verificatio"
