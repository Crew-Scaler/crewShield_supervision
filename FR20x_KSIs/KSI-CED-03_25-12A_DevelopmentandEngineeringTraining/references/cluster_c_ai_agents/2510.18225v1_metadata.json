  "summary": "This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro level, the master AUV models the agent selecti"
