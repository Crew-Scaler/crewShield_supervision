  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in which multiple agents argue, critique, and coordinate to solve complex tasks, making communication topology a first-class design choice. Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for"
