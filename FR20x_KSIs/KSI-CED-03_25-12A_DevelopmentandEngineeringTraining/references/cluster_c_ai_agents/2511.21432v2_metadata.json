  "summary": "This paper addresses resilient collaborative localization in multi-agent systems exposed to spoofed radio frequency measurements. Each agent maintains multiple hypotheses of its own state and exchanges selected information with neighbors using covariance intersection. Geometric reductions based on distance tests and convex hull structure limit the number of hypotheses transmitted, controlling the spread of hypotheses through the network. The method enables agents to separate spoofed and truthful"
