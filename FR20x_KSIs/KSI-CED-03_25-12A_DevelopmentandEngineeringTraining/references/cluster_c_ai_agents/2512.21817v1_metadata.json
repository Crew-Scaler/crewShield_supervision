  "summary": "Intelligent IoT systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate task-execution methods for dynamic environments. However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using e"
