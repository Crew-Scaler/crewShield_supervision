  "summary": "Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) represent a promising architecture that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial nodes to provide enhanced coverage, reliability, and throughput for diverse applications. However, these networks face significant security vulnerabilities from both known and potential unknown eavesdroppers, which may threaten data confidentiality and system integrity. To solve this critical issue, we propose a novel secure communication framework for LAWNs where t"
