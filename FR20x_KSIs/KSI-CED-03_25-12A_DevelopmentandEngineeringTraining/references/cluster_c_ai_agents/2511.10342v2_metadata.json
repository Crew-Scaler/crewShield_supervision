  "summary": "This study introduces an agent-based model to study how regret, uncertainty, and social norms interact to shape vaccination behavior during epidemics. The model integrates three behavioral mechanisms, anticipated regret, evolving norms, and uncertainty-dependent trust, within a unified learning framework. Grounded in psychology and behavioral economics, it captures how individuals make probabilistic choices influenced by material payoffs, fear, trust, and social approval. Simulations of the Susc"
