  "summary": "This paper examines resilient dynamic leader-follower consensus within multi-agent systems, where agents share first-order or second-order dynamics. The aim is to develop distributed protocols enabling nonfaulty/normal followers to accurately track a dynamic/time-varying reference value of the leader while they may receive misinformation from adversarial neighbors. Our methodologies employ the mean subsequence reduced algorithm with agents engaging with neighbors using multi-hop communication. W"
