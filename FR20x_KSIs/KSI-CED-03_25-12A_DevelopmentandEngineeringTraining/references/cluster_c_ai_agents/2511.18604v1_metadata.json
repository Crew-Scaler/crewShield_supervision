  "summary": "This study informs the design of future multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) and multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) algorithms by guiding choices based on constraint classification for constraint-based search algorithms. We categorize constraints as conservative or aggressive and provide insights into their search behavior, focusing specifically on vanilla Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Conflict-Based Search with Priorities (CBSw/P). Under a hybrid grid-roadmap representation with varying resolution,"
