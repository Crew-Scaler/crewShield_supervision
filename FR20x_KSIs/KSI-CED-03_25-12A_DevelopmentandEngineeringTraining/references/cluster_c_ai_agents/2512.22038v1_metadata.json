  "summary": "Large-scale competitive platforms are interacting multi-agent systems in which latent skills drift over time and pairwise interactions are shaped by matchmaking. We study a controlled rating dynamics in the mean-field limit and derive a kinetic description for the joint evolution of skills and ratings. In the Gaussian regime, we prove an exact moment closure and obtain a low-dimensional deterministic state dynamics for rating accuracy. This yields three main insights. First, skill drift imposes "
