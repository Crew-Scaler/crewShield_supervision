  "summary": "Modern large language model (LLM) services increasingly rely on complex, often abstract operations, such as multi-step reasoning and multi-agent collaboration, to generate high-quality outputs. While users are billed based on token consumption and API usage, these internal steps are typically not visible. We refer to such systems as Commercial Opaque LLM Services (COLS). This position paper highlights emerging accountability challenges in COLS: users are billed for operations they cannot observe"
