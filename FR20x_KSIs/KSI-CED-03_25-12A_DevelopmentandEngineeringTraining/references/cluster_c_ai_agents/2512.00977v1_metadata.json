  "summary": "We present Crystalyse, an open, provenance-enforced scientific agent for computational materials design of inorganic crystals that orchestrates tools for compositional screening, crystal structure generation, and machine-learning force-field evaluation. Crystalyse offers three operating modes to trade exploration speed against validation depth: creative (rapid query), adaptive (context-aware routing) and rigorous (comprehensive checks). We release the underlying source code and evaluation script"
