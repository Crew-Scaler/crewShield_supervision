  "summary": "In this paper, we study an information-theoretic problem of designing a fair representation under a bounded point-wise statistical (demographic) parity constraint. More specifically, an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded point-wise statistical parity, that is, such that for all realizations of the representation $y\\"
