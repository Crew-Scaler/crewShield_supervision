  "summary": "Competitive access to modern observatories has intensified as proposal volumes outpace available telescope time, making timely, consistent, and transparent peer review a critical bottleneck for the advancement of astronomy. Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stage"
