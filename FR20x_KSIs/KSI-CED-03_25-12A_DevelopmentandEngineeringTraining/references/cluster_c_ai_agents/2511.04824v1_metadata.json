  "summary": "Agentic coding tools, such as OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor, are transforming the software engineering landscape. These AI-powered systems function as autonomous teammates capable of planning and executing complex development tasks. Agents have become active participants in refactoring, a cornerstone of sustainable software development aimed at improving internal code quality without altering observable behavior. Despite their increasing adoption, there is a critical lack of empirical un"
