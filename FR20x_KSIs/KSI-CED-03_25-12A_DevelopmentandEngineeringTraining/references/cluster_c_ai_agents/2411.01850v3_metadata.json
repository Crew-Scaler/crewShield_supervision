  "summary": "Embodied agents require robust spatial intelligence to execute precise real-world manipulations. However, this remains a significant challenge, as current methods often struggle to accurately position objects in space. Collecting extensive data can help address this issue by enhancing the agent's spatial understanding. Nonetheless, obtaining such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data frequently leads to visual generalization gaps during real-world deplo"
