  "summary": "Deep research systems represent an emerging class of agentic information retrieval methods that generate comprehensive and well-supported reports to complex queries. However, most existing frameworks rely on dynamic commercial search APIs, which pose reproducibility and transparency challenges in addition to their cost. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textsc{DeepResearchGym} as an open-source sandbox that combines a reproducible search API with a rigorous evaluation protocol for benc"
