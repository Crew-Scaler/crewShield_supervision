  "summary": "Large-scale networked multi-agent systems increasingly underpin critical infrastructure, yet their collective behavior can drift toward undesirable emergent norms that elude conventional governance mechanisms. We introduce an adaptive accountability framework that (i) continuously traces responsibility flows through a lifecycle-aware audit ledger, (ii) detects harmful emergent norms online via decentralized sequential hypothesis tests, and (iii) deploys local policy and reward-shaping interventi"
