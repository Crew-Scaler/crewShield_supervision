Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and"
