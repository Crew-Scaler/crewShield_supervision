  "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI have enabled sophisticated multi-agent architectures for healthcare, where large language models power collaborative clinical decision-making. However, these distributed systems face critical challenges in ensuring message integrity and fault tolerance when operating in adversarial or untrusted environments.This paper presents a novel Byzantine fault-tolerant multi-agent system specifically designed for healthcare applications, integrating gossip-based message pr"
