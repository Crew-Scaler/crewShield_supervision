  "summary": "The increasing complexity of cyber threats in distributed environments demands advanced frameworks for real-time detection and response across multimodal data streams. This paper introduces AgenticCyber, a generative AI powered multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized agents to monitor cloud logs, surveillance videos, and environmental audio concurrently. The solution achieves 96.2% F1-score in threat detection, reduces response latency to 420 ms, and enables adaptive security posture ma"
