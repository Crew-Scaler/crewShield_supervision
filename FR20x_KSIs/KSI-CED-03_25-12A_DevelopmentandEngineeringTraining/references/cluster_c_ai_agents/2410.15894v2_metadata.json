  "summary": "The rise of AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents critical challenges: how to securely execute and migrate these agents across heterogeneous environments while protecting sensitive user data, maintaining availability during network failures, minimizing response latency for time-critical decisions, and ensuring output safety in mission-critical applications. We present MVVM, a WebAssembly-based secure container framework that enables transparent live migration of LLM agent wo"
