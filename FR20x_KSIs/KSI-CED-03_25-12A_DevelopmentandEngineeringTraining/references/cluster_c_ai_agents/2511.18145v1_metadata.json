  "summary": "Engineering programmes in Latin America combine high structural rigidity, intense assessment cultures and persistent socio-economic inequality, producing dropout rates that remain stubbornly high despite increasingly accurate early-warning models. Predictive learning analytics can identify students at risk, but they offer limited guidance on which concrete combinations of policies should be implemented, when, and for whom. This paper presents the CAPIRE Intervention Lab, an agent-based simulatio"
