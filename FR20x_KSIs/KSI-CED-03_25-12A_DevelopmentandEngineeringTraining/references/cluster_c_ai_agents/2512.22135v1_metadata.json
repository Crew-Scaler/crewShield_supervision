  "summary": "As the internet evolves from the mobile App-dominated Attention Economy to the Intent-Interconnection of the Agentic Web era, existing interaction modes fail to address the escalating challenges of data lock-in and cognitive overload. Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data"
