  "summary": "Software engineering agents (swe-agents), as key innovations in intelligent software engineering, are poised in the industry's end-of-programming debate to transcend from assistance to primary roles. we argue the importance of swe-agents' economic viability to their transcendence -- defined as their capacity to maintain efficient operations in constrained environments -- and propose its exploration via software engineering economics experimentation.we introduce ghissuemarket sandbox, a controlle"
