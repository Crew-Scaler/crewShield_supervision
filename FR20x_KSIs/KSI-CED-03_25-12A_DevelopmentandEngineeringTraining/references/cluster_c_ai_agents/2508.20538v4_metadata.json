  "summary": "We study sequential social learning with continuous actions and conformity when agents can endogenously generate hard, publicly verifiable evidence. Actions transmit soft information whose visibility depends on responsiveness to private signals and on observational granularity; investigations produce hard evidence only in the true state and, once found, are disclosed and reset public beliefs. We deliver two primitives. First, a soft-channel informativeness threshold characterizes when actions re"
