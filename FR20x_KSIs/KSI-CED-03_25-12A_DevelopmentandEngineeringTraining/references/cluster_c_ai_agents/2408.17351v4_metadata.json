  "summary": "SmartNICs are increasingly deployed in datacenters to offload tasks from server CPUs, improving the efficiency and flexibility of datacenter security, networking and storage. Optimizing cloud server efficiency in this way is critically important to ensure that virtually all server resources are available to paying customers. Userspace system software, specifically, decision-making tasks performed by various operating system subsystems, is particularly well suited for execution on mid-tier SmartN"
