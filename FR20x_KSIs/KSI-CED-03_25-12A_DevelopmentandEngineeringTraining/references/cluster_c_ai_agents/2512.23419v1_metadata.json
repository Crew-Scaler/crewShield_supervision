  "summary": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of sc"
