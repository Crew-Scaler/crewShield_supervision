  "summary": "Recommender Systems (RSs) have become the cornerstone of various applications such as e-commerce and social media platforms. The evolution of RSs is paramount in the digital era, in which personalised user experience is tailored to the user's preferences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a new paradigm - generative retrieval and recommendation. Despite their potential, generative RS methods face issues such as hallucination, which degrades the recommendation performance, and high comput"
