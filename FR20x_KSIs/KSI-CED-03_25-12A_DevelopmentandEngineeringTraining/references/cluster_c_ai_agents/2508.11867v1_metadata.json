  "summary": "Modern software delivery has accelerated from quarterly releases to multiple deployments per day. While CI/CD tooling has matured, human decision points interpreting flaky tests, choosing rollback strategies, tuning feature flags, and deciding when to promote a canary remain major sources of latency and operational toil. We propose AI-Augmented CI/CD Pipelines, where large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents act as policy-bounded co-pilots and progressively as decision makers. We contri"
