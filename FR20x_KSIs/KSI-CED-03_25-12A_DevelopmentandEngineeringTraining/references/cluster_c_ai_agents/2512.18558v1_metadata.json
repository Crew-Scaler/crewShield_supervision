  "summary": "Learning-based traffic signal control is typically optimized for average performance under a few nominal demand patterns, which can result in poor behavior under atypical traffic conditions. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for signal control on a 3x3 urban grid calibrated from a contiguous 3x3 subarea of central Athens covered by the pNEUMA trajectory dataset (Barmpounakis and Geroliminis, 2020). Our approach proceeds in three st"
