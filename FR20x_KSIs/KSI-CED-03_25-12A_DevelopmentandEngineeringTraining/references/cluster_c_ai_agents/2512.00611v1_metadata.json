  "summary": "Prism is a small, compositional metalanguage for specifying the behaviour of tool-using software agents. Rather than introducing ad hoc control constructs, Prism is built around a fixed core context, Core1, which provides a minimal background grammar of categories numbers, strings, user prompts, tools together with abstract combinators for booleans, predicates, pairs, and lists. Agent policies are written as ordinary expressions using a single abstraction operator so that conditionals appear as "
