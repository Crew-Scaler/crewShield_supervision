  "summary": "The design of chiral metasurfaces with tailored optical properties remains a central challenge in nanophotonics due to the highly nonlinear relationship between geometry and chiroptical response. Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an "
