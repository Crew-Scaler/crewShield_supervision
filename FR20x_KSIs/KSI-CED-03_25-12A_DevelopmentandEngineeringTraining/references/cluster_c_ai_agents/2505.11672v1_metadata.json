  "summary": "Terms of Service (ToS) documents are often lengthy and written in complex legal language, making them difficult for users to read and understand. To address this challenge, we propose Terminators, a modular agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse and audit ToS documents. Rather than treating ToS understanding as a black-box summarization problem, Terminators breaks the task down to three interpretable steps: term extraction, verification, and accountability plannin"
