  "summary": "Browser-using agents (BUAs) are an emerging class of autonomous agents that interact with web browsers in human-like ways, including clicking, scrolling, filling forms, and navigating across pages. While these agents help automate repetitive online tasks, they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks that can trick an agent into performing undesired actions, such as leaking private information or issuing state-changing requests. We propose ceLLMate, a browser-level sandboxing framework that re"
