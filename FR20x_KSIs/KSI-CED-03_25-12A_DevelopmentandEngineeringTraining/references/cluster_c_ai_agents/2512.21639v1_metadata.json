  "summary": "We recast rational inattention as a Bayesian predictive decision problem in which the agent reports a predictive distribution and is evaluated by a proper local scoring rule. This yields a direct link to rate-distortion theory and shows that Shannon entropy emerges endogenously as the honest local utility for predictive refinement. Bernardo's characterization of proper local scoring rules together with Shannon's amalgamation invariance imply that the logarithmic score, and hence mutual informati"
