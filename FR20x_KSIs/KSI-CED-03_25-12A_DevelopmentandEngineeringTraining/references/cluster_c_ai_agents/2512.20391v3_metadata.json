  "summary": "Cooperative collision avoidance between robots, or `agents,' in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each agent is responsible for making its own decisions and choosing its control actions. Most existing approaches rely on a (wireless) communication network between (some of) the agents. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, and transmission faults. Moreover, it is subject to ad"
