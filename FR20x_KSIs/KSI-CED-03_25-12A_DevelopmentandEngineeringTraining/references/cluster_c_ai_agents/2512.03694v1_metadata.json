  "summary": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with large language models (LLMs) enable personalized education but risk leaking minors personally identifiable information (PII) via unstructured dialogue. Existing privacy methods struggle to balance security and utility: role-based access control fails on unstructured text, while naive masking destroys pedagogical context. We propose SRPG, a privacy guard for educational MAS, using a Dual-Stream Reconstruction Mechanism: a strict sanitization stream ensures zero PII "
