  "summary": "We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among agents, with a focus on limiting envy. A central open question in this area is the existence of EFX allocations-allocations in which any envy of any agent i towards any agent j vanishes upon the removal of any single good from j's bundle. Establishing the existence of such allocations has proven notoriously difficult in general, but progress has been made for restricted valuation classes. Christodoulou et al. [2023] proved existence for gra"
