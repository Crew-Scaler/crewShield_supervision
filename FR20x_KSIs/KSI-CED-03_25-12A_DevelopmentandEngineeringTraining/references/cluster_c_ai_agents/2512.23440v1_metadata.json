  "summary": "Clinical diagnosis begins with doctor-patient interaction, during which physicians iteratively gather information, determine examination and refine differential diagnosis through patients' response. This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contami"
