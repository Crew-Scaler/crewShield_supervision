  "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents significant advancements but also introduces novel security challenges, particularly within agentic workflows where AI agents operate autonomously. These risks escalate in multi-agent systems due to increased interaction complexity. This paper outlines critical security vulnerabilities inherent in GenAI agentic workflows, including data privacy breaches, model manipulation, and issues related to agent autonomy and system integration. It discuss"
