  "summary": "As networks move toward the next-generation 6G, Intent-based Management (IbM) systems are increasingly adopted to simplify and automate network management by translating high-level intents into low-level configurations. Within these systems, agents play a critical role in monitoring current state of the network, gathering data, and enforcing actions across the network to fulfill the intent. However, ensuring secure and fine-grained authorization of agents remains a significant challenge, especia"
