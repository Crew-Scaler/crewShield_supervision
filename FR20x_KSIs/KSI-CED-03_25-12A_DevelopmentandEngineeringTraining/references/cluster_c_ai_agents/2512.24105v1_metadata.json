  "summary": "We introduce the concept of multilevel fair allocation of resources with tree-structured hierarchical relations among agents. While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms whic"
