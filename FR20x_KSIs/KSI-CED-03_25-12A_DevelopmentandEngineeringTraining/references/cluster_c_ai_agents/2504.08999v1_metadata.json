  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with external tools through standardized interfaces like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). However, current MCP implementations face critical limitations: they typically require local process execution through STDIO transports, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, web browsers, and edge computing. We present MCP Bridge, a lightweight RESTful proxy that connects to multiple MCP servers and expose"
