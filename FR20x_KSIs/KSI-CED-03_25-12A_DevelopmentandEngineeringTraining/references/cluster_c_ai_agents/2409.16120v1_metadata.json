  "summary": "Developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) faces significant challenges in achieving true Turing completeness and adaptive, code-driven evolution. Current approaches often generate code independently of its runtime context, relying heavily on the LLM's memory, which results in inefficiencies and limits adaptability. Manual protocol development in sandbox environments further constrains the agent's autonomous adaptability. Crucially, achieving consistency in code and context acr"
