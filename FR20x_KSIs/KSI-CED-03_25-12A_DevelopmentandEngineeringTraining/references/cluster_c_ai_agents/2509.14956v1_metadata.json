  "summary": "This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potentia"
