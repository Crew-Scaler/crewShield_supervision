  "summary": "We develop a continuous-time model of reputational disclosure in directed networks of biased intermediaries with career concerns. A payoff-relevant fundamental follows a diffusion and a decision maker chooses actions to track it. Experts obtain verifiable signals that reach the decision maker only if relayed by intermediaries. Intermediaries choose whether to forward evidence and an observable disclosure clock that controls the arrival rate of disclosure opportunities. Because clocks are public,"
