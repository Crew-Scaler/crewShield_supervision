  "summary": "A growing class of ultrasound-mediated diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, including sonoporation and blood-brain barrier modulation, relies on microbubble contrast agents, where precise control of microbubble dynamics governs biological responses, efficiency, and safety. However, quantitative monitoring of microbubble oscillations in the stable, weakly nonlinear regime remains challenging, particularly in optically opaque and deep-tissue environments. Here, we introduce a linear acoustic w"
