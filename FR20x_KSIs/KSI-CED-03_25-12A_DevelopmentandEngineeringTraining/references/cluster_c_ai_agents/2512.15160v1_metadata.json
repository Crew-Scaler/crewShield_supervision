  "summary": "Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for \"thinking with images\" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not add"
