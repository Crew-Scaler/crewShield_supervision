  "summary": "The Secure Scientific Service Mesh (S3M) provides API-driven infrastructure to accelerate scientific discovery through automated research workflows. By integrating near real-time streaming capabilities, intelligent workflow orchestration, and fine-grained authorization within a service mesh architecture, S3M revolutionizes programmatic access to high performance computing (HPC) while maintaining uncompromising security. This framework allows intelligent agents and experimental facilities to dyna"
