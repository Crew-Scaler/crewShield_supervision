  "summary": "Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architect"
