  "summary": "We study the mean-field limit for a class of agent-based models describing flocking with nonlinear velocity alignment. Each agent interacts through a communication protocol $\u03c6$ and a non-linear coupling of velocities given by the power law $A(\\bv) = |\\bv|^{p-2}\\bv$, $p &gt; 2$. The mean-field limit is proved in two settings -- deterministic and stochastic. We then provide quantitative estimates on propagation of chaos for deterministic case in the case of the classical fat-tailed kernels, showin"
