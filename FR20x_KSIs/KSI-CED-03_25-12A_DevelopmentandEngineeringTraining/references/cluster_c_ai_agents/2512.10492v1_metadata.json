  "summary": "Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationa"
