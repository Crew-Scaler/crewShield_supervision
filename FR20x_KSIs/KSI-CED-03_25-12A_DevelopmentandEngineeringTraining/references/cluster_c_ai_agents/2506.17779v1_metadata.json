  "summary": "Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode (granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard interactions) across three levels in a standa"
