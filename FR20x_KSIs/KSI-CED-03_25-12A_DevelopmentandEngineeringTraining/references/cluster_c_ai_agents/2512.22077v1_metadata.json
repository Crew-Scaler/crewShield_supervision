  "summary": "Habitat loss and fragmentation have often been viewed as major threats to species interaction and global biodiversity conservation. However, habitat degradation can also give rise to positive ecological and behavioral responses, challenging the notion that its consequences are entirely detrimental. While controlling for the degree of total habitat loss, we studied the influence of habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity on the evolution of tag-based cooperation in structured populations w"
