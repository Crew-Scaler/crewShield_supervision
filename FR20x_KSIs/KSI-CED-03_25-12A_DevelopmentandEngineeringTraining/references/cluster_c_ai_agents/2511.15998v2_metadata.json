  "summary": "Generative AI is reshaping offensive cybersecurity by enabling autonomous red team agents that can plan, execute, and adapt during penetration tests. However, existing approaches face trade-offs between generality and specialization, and practical deployments reveal challenges such as hallucinations, context limitations, and ethical concerns. In this work, we introduce a novel command &amp; control (C2) architecture leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate distributed, adaptive "
