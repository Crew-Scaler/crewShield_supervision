  "summary": "Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) pose a structural threat to the global digital economy. Algorithms like Shor's factoring and Grover's search threaten to dismantle the public-key infrastructure (PKI) securing sovereign communications and financial transactions. While the timeline for fault-tolerant CRQCs remains probabilistic, the \"Store-Now, Decrypt-Later\" (SNDL) model necessitates immediate migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). This transition is hindered by the vel"
