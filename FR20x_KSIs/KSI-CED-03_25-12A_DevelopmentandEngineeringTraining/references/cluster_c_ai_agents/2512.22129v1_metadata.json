  "summary": "Ad-hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to infer the behavior of previously unseen teammates and adapt their policy accordingly. Conventional approaches often rely on fixed probabilistic models or classifiers, which can be brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a flexible alternative: by mapping short behavioral traces into high-level hypotheses, they can serve as world models over teammate behavior. We introduce \\Collab, a language-based fr"
