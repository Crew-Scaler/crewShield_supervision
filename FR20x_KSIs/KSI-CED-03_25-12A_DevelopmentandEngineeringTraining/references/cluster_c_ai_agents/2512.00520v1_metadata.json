  "summary": "Background: Autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving a paradigm shift toward an \"Internet of Agents\" (IoA). While offering immense potential, this vision also introduces novel and systemic risks to safety and security. Objectives: Unlike common threat-centric taxonomies, our survey provides a principled, architectural framework for engineering safe and reliable agentic systems. We aim to identify the architectural sources of vulnerabilities to establish a foundation "
