  "summary": "Large language models have advanced software engineering automation, yet resolving real-world software issues remains difficult because it requires repository-level reasoning, accurate diagnostics, and strong verification signals. Existing agent-based and pipeline-based methods often rely on insufficient tests, which can lead to patches that satisfy verification but fail to fix the underlying defect. We present InfCode, an adversarial multi-agent framework for automated repository-level issue re"
