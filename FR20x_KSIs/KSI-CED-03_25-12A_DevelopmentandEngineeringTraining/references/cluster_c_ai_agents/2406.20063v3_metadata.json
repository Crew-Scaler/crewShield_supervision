  "summary": "This paper studies a loss-averse version of the multiplicative habit formation preference and the corresponding optimal investment and consumption strategies over an infinite horizon. The agent's consumption preference is depicted by a general S-shaped utility function of her consumption-to-habit ratio. By considering the concave envelope of the S-shaped utility and the associated dual value function, we provide a thorough analysis of the HJB equation for the concavified problem via studying a r"
