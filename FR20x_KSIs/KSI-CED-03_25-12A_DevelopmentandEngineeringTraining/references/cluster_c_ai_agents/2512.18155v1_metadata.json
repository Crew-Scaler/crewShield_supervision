  "summary": "Timely updates are critical for real-time monitoring and control applications powered by the Internet of Things (IoT). As these systems scale, they become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious agents interfere with legitimate transmissions to reduce data rates, thereby inflating the age of information (AoI). Existing adversarial AoI models often assume stationary channels and overlook queueing dynamics arising from compromised sensing sources operating under resource co"
