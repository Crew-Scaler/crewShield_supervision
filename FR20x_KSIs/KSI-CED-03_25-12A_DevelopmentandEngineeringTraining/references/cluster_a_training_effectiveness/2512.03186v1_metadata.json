  "summary": "Hand grip strength is a widely used clinical biomarker linked to mobility, frailty, surgical outcomes, and overall health. This work explores a novel, phone only approach for estimating grip related force using a smartphone's built in vibration motor and inertial measurement unit. When the phone vibrates, applied finger force modulates the amplitude of high frequency accelerometer and gyroscope signals through Vibrometric Force Estimation. We profiled a Google Pixel 4 using synchronized IMU data"
