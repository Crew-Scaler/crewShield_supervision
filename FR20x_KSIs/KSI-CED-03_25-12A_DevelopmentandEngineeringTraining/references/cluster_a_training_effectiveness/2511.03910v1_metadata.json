  "summary": "The detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range is the goal of current and future in-ice radio arrays at the South Pole and in Greenland. Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the neutrino flavor. For the first time, we pred"
