  "summary": "Detecting spoofing attacks to Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite systems is a cornerstone to assessing the authenticity of the received information and guaranteeing robust service delivery in several application domains. The solutions available today for spoofing detection either rely on additional communication systems, receivers, and antennas, or require mobile deployments. Detection systems working at the Physical (PHY) layer of the satellite communication link also require time-consuming and en"
