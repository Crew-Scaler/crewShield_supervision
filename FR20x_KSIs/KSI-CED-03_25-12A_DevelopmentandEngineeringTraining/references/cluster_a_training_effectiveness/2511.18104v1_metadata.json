  "summary": "The proliferation of videos generated by diffusion models has raised increasing concerns about information security, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection of synthetic media. Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our appro"
