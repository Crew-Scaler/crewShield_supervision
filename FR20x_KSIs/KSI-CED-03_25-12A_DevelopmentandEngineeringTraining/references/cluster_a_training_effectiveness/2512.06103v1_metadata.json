  "summary": "Iris recognition is widely recognized as one of the most accurate biometric modalities. However, its growing deployment in real-world applications raises significant concerns regarding its vulnerability to Presentation Attacks (PAs). Effective Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) is therefore critical to ensure the integrity and security of iris-based biometric systems. While conventional iris recognition systems predominantly operate in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, multispectral imaging acr"
