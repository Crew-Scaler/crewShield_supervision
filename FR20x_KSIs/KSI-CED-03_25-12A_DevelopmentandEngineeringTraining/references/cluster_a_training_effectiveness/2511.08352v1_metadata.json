  "summary": "As cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and frequency, robust endpoint protection is essential for organizational security. This paper presents \"Endpoint Security Agent: A Comprehensive Approach to Real-time System Monitoring and Threat Detection\" a modular, real-time security solution for Windows endpoints. The agent leverages native tools like WMI and ETW for lowlevel monitoring of system activities such as process execution, registry modifications, and network behaviour. A machine l"
