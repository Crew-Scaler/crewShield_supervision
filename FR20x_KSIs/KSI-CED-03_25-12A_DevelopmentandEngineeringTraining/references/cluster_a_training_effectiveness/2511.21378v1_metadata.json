  "summary": "Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dy"
