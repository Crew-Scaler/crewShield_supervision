  "summary": "Evaluating security and reliability for multi-agent systems (MAS) is urgent as they become increasingly prevalent in various applications. As an evaluation technique, existing adversarial attack frameworks face certain limitations, e.g., impracticality due to the requirement of white-box information or high control authority, and a lack of stealthiness or effectiveness as they often target all agents or specific fixed agents. To address these issues, we propose AdapAM, a novel framework for adve"
