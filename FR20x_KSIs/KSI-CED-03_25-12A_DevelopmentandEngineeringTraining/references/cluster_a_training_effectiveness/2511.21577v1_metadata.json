  "summary": "The availability of high-quality, AI-generated audio raises security challenges such as misinformation campaigns and voice-cloning fraud. A key defense against the misuse of AI-generated audio is by watermarking it, so that it can be easily distinguished from genuine audio. As those seeking to misuse AI-generated audio may thus seek to remove audio watermarks, studying effective watermark removal techniques is critical to being able to objectively evaluate the robustness of audio watermarks agai"
