  "summary": "Machine learning models for forecasting solar flares have been trained and tested using a variety of data sources, such as Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) operational and science-quality data. Typically, data from these sources is minimally processed before being used to train and validate a forecasting model. However, predictive performance can be impaired if defects in and inconsistencies between these data sources are ignored. For a number of commonly used data sources, together with s"
