  "summary": "Context. Developing secure and reliable software remains a key challenge in software engineering (SE). The ever-evolving technological landscape offers both opportunities and threats, creating a dynamic space where chaos and order compete. Secure software engineering (SSE) must continuously address vulnerabilities that endanger software systems and carry broader socio-economic risks, such as compromising critical national infrastructure and causing significant financial losses.
