  "summary": "Federated learning (FL) allows machine learning models to be trained on distributed datasets without directly accessing local data. In FL markets, numerous Data Consumers compete to recruit Data Owners for their respective training tasks, but budget constraints and competition can prevent them from securing sufficient data. While existing solutions focus on optimizing one-to-one matching between Data Owners and Data Consumers, we propose \\methodname{}, a novel framework that facilitates collabor"
