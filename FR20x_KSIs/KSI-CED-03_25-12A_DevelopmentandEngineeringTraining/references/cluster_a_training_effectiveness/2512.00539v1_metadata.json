  "summary": "The widespread misuse of image generation technologies has raised security concerns, driving the development of AI-generated image detection methods. However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design S"
