  "summary": "To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this pap"
