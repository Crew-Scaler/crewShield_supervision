  "summary": "As concerns regarding privacy in deep learning continue to grow, individuals are increasingly apprehensive about the potential exploitation of their personal knowledge in trained models. Despite several research efforts to address this, they often fail to consider the real-world demand from users for complete knowledge erasure. Furthermore, our investigation reveals that existing methods have a risk of leaking personal knowledge through embedding features. To address these issues, we introduce a"
