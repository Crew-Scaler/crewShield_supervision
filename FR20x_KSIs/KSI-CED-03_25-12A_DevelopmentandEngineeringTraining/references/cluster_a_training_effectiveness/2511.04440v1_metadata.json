  "summary": "Magecart skimming attacks have emerged as a significant threat to client-side security and user trust in online payment systems. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and explainable detection of Magecart attacks through a comparative study of various Machine Learning (ML) models with a real-world dataset. Tree-based, linear, and kernel-based models were applied, further enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, to distinguish between benign and malicious scr"
