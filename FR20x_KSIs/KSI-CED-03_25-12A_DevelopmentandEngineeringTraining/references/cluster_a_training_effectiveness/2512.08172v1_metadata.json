  "summary": "At ASIACRYPT 2018, a digital attack based on linear least squares was introduced for a variant of the learning with errors (LWE) problem which omits modular reduction known as the integer learning with errors problem (ILWE). In this paper, we present a theoretical and experimental study of the effectiveness of the attack when applied directly to small parameter ILWE instances found in popular digital signature schemes such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium which utilize rejection sampling. Unlike other stud"
