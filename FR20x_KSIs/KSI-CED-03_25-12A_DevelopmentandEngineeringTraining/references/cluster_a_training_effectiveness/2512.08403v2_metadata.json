  "summary": "Audio deepfake detection has recently garnered public concern due to its implications for security and reliability. Traditional deep learning methods have been widely applied to this task but often lack generalisability when confronted with newly emerging spoofing techniques and more tasks such as spoof attribution recognition rather than simple binary classification. In principle, Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to possess the needed generalisation capabilities. However, previous re"
