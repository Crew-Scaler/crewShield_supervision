  "summary": "The integration of immersive technologies has transformed engineering education, particularly in high-risk disciplines like high-voltage engineering, which is essential for urban energy infrastructure. This study presents a 3D virtual laboratory developed using Unreal Engine 5 to support the High Voltage Engineering course for undergraduate students in Power Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Electromechanics. The research investigates how an immersive, gamified virtual laboratory enhances"
