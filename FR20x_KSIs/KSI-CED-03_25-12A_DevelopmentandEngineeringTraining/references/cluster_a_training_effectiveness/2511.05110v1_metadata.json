  "summary": "The IP-stride prefetcher has recently been exploited to leak secrets through side-channel attacks. It, however, cannot be simply disabled for security with prefetching speedup as a sacrifice. The state-of-the-art defense tries to retain the prefetching effect by hardware modification. In this paper, we present PhantomFetch as the first prefetching-retentive and hardware-agnostic defense. It avoids potential remanufacturing cost and enriches applicability to off-the-shelf devices. The key idea is"
