  "summary": "The DataSquad at Carleton College addresses a common problem at small liberal arts colleges: limited capacity for data services and few opportunities for students to gain practical experience with data and software development. Academic Technologist Paula Lackie designed the program as a work-study position that trains undergraduates through structured peer mentorship and real client projects. Students tackle data problems of increasing complexity-from basic data analysis to software development"
