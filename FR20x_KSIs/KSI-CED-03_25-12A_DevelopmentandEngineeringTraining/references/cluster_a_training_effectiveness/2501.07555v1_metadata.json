  "summary": "Continual Learning (CL) methods aim to learn from a sequence of tasks while avoiding the challenge of forgetting previous knowledge. We present DREAM-CL, a novel CL method for ECG arrhythmia detection that introduces dynamic prototype rehearsal memory. DREAM-CL selects representative prototypes by clustering data based on learning behavior during each training session. Within each cluster, we apply a smooth sorting operation that ranks samples by training difficulty, compressing extreme values a"
