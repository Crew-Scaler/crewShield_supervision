  "summary": "Adversarial Patrolling games form a subclass of Security games where a Defender moves between locations, guarding vulnerable targets. The main algorithmic problem is constructing a strategy for the Defender that minimizes the worst damage an Attacker can cause. We focus on the class of finite-memory (also known as regular) Defender's strategies that experimentally outperformed other competing classes. A finite-memory strategy can be seen as a positional strategy on a finite set of states. Each s"
