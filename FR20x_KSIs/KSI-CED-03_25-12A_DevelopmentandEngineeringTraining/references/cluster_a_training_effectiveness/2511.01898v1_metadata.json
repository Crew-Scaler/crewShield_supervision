  "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data but suffers from limited scalability, high communication costs, and privacy risks due to its centralized architecture. This paper proposes FedSelect-ME, a hierarchical multi-edge FL framework that enhances scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Multiple edge servers distribute workloads and perform score-based client selection, prioritizing participants based on utility, energy efficiency, and data sensi"
