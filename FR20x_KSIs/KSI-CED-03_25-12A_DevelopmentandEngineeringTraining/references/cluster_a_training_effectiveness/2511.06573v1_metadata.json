  "summary": "Secure data hiding remains a fundamental challenge in digital communication, requiring a careful balance between computational efficiency and perceptual transparency. The balance between security and performance is increasingly fragile with the emergence of generative AI systems capable of autonomously generating and optimising sophisticated cryptanalysis and steganalysis algorithms, thereby accelerating the exposure of vulnerabilities in conventional data-hiding schemes.\n  This work introduces "
