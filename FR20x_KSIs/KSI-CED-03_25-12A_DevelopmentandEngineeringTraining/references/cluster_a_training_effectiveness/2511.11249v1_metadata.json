  "summary": "Data normalization is a crucial preprocessing step for enhancing model performance and training stability. In federated learning (FL), where data remains distributed across multiple parties during collaborative model training, normalization presents unique challenges due to the decentralized and often heterogeneous nature of the data. Traditional methods rely on either independent client-side processing, i.e., local normalization, or normalizing the entire dataset before distributing it to parti"
