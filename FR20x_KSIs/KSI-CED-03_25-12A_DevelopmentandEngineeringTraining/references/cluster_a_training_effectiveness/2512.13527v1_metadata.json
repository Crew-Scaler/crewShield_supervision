  "summary": "Purpose: To develop DarkSPARC, a retrospective, training-free, self-calibrated spectral reconstruction method that converts routine bright-blood 3D left atrial (LA) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI into a dark-blood image, and to quantify its impact on LA scar-pool CNR, SNR, effective CNR (eCNR), and scar quantification accuracy.\n  Methods: DarkSPARC embeds bright-blood LA LGE into a calibrator-conditioned (N+1)-dimensional spectral domain and reconstructs a dark-blood-like image using scan"
