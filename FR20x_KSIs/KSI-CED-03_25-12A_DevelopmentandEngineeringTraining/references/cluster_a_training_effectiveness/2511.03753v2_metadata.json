  "summary": "This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated EC"
