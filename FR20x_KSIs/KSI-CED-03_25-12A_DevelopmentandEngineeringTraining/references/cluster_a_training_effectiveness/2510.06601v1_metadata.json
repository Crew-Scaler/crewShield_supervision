  "summary": "We introduce the AIM 2025 Real-World RAW Image Denoising Challenge, aiming to advance efficient and effective denoising techniques grounded in data synthesis. The competition is built upon a newly established evaluation benchmark featuring challenging low-light noisy images captured in the wild using five different DSLR cameras. Participants are tasked with developing novel noise synthesis pipelines, network architectures, and training methodologies to achieve high performance across different c"
