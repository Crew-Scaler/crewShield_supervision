  "summary": "The multi-phase inverter has become more complicated, particularly in an Electric Vehicle (EV)'s power train, which requires a robust fault protection system. The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascad"
