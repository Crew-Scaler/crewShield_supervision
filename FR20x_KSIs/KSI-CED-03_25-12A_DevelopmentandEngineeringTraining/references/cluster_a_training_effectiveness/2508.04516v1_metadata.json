  "summary": "Traditional hardware platforms - ASICs and FPGAs - offer competing trade-offs among performance, flexibility, and sustainability. ASICs provide high efficiency but are inflexible post-fabrication, require costly re-spins for updates, and expose IPs to piracy risks. FPGAs offer reconfigurability and reuse, yet suffer from substantial area, power, and performance overheads, resulting in higher carbon footprints. We present ECOLogic, a hybrid design paradigm that embeds lightweight eFPGA fabric wit"
