  "summary": "This paper presents a secure aggregation system Armadillo that has disruptive resistance against adversarial clients, such that any coalition of malicious clients (within the tolerated threshold) can affect the aggregation result only by misreporting their private inputs in a pre-defined legitimate range. Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior wor"
