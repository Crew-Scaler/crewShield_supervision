  "summary": "The adoption of reinforcement learning for critical infrastructure defense introduces a vulnerability where sophisticated attackers can strategically exploit the defense algorithm's learning dynamics. While prior work addresses this vulnerability in the context of repeated normal-form games, its extension to the stochastic games remains an open research gap. We close this gap by examining stochastic security games between an RL defender and an omniscient attacker, utilizing a tractable linear in"
