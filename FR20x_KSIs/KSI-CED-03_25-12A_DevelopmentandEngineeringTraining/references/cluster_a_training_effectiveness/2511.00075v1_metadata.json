  "summary": "Quarter level cell (QLC) 3D NAND flash memory is emerging as the predominant storage solution in the era of artificial intelligence. QLC 3D NAND flash stores 4 bit per cell to expand the storage density, resulting in narrower read margins. Constrained to read margins, QLC always suffers from lateral charge migration (LCM), which caused by non-uniform charge density across adjacent memory cells. To suppress charge density gap between cells, there are some algorithm in form of intra-page data mapp"
