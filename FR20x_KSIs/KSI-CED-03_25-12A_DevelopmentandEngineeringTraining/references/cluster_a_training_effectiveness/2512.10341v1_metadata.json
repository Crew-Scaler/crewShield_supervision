  "summary": "Distributed machine learning systems require strong privacy guarantees, verifiable compliance, and scalable deployment across heterogeneous and multi-cloud environments. This work introduces a cloud-native privacy-preserving architecture that integrates federated learning, differential privacy, zero-knowledge compliance proofs, and adaptive governance powered by reinforcement learning. The framework supports secure model training and inference without centralizing sensitive data, while enabling "
