  "summary": "Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs, significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration, enabling timely preventative interventions.\n  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\\% male) who experienced aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspirat"
