  "summary": "This study bridges cognitive science and neural network design by examining whether artificial models exhibit human-like forgetting curves. Drawing upon Ebbinghaus' seminal work on memory decay and principles of spaced repetition, we propose a quantitative framework to measure information retention in neural networks. Our approach computes the recall probability by evaluating the similarity between a network's current hidden state and previously stored prototype representations. This retention m"
