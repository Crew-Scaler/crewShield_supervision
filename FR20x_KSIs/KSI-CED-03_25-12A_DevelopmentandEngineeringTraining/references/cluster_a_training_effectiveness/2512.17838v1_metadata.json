  "summary": "Autonomous coding agents built on large language models (LLMs) can now solve many general software and machine learning tasks, but they remain ineffective on complex, domain-specific scientific problems. Medical imaging is a particularly demanding domain, requiring long training cycles, high-dimensional data handling, and specialized preprocessing and validation pipelines, capabilities not fully measured in existing agent benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 c"
