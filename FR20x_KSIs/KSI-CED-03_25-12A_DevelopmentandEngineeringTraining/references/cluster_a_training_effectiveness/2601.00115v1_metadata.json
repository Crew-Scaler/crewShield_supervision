  "summary": "This paper develops a gradient-based meta-learning framework for real-time control of waveguided pinching-antenna systems under user-location uncertainty and physical-layer security (PLS) constraints. A probabilistic system model is introduced to capture the impact of imperfect localization on outage performance and secrecy. Based on this model, a joint antenna-positioning and transmit-power optimization problem is formulated to satisfy probabilistic reliability and secrecy requirements. To enab"
