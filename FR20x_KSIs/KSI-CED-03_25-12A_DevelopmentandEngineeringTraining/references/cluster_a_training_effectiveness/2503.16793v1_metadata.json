  "summary": "Continual learning aims to accumulate knowledge over a data stream while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In Non-exemplar Class Incremental Learning (NECIL), forgetting arises during incremental optimization because old classes are inaccessible, hindering the retention of prior knowledge. To solve this, previous methods struggle in achieving the stability-plasticity balance in the training stages. However, we note that the testing stage is rarely considered among them, but is promising to be "
