  "summary": "Magnet errors in storage rings significantly degrade beam performance, impacting the brightness and stability of the light source. Therefore, beam-based correction is crucial for the safe operation of machines and the stability of radiated photons. Unlike traditional correction methods such as linear optics from closed orbit, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML) framework to directly predict quadrupole/sextupole gradient errors and misalignment from beam position monitor-measured optics f"
