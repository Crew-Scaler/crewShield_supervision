  "summary": "First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases.
