  "summary": "Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is extensively used in knowledge extraction, cognitive concept learning, and data mining. However, its computational demands on large-scale datasets often require outsourcing to external computing services, raising concerns about the leakage of sensitive information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to enhance data security and privacy in FCA-based computations. Specifically, we introduce a Privacy-preserving Formal Context Analysis (PFCA) fram"
