  "summary": "Large language Models (LLMs) are usually used to answer questions, but many high-stakes applications (e.g., tutoring, clinical support) require the complementary skill of asking questions: detecting missing information, requesting clarifications, and using them to solve tasks. We study this skill in reasoning-heavy domains where progress depends on inquiry rather than factual recall. We define an interactive protocol where a student model engages a stronger teacher under a small turn budget. Aft"
