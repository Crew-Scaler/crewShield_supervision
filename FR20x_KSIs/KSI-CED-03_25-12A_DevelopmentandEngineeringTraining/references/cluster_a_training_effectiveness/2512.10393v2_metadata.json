  "summary": "Retrieving binary code via natural language queries is a pivotal capability for downstream tasks in the software security domain, such as vulnerability detection and malware analysis. However, it is challenging to identify binary functions semantically relevant to the user query from thousands of candidates, as the absence of symbolic information distinguishes this task from source code retrieval. In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, a two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped bina"
