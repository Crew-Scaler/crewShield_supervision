  "summary": "Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data. Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net, and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based meth"
