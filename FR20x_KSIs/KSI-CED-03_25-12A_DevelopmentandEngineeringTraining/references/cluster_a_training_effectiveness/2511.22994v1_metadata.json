  "summary": "The security of biometric authentication is increasingly critical as digital identity systems expand. Iris recognition offers high reliability due to its distinctive and stable texture patterns. Recent progress in deep learning, especially Vision Transformers ViT, has improved visual recognition performance. Yet, the effect of optimizer choice on ViT-based biometric systems remains understudied. This work evaluates how different optimizers influence the accuracy and stability of ViT for iris rec"
