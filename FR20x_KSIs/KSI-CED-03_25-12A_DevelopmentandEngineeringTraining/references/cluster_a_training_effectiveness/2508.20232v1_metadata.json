  "summary": "This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\\,M parameters) to lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated: Compact (1.3\\,M parameters), Standard (2."
