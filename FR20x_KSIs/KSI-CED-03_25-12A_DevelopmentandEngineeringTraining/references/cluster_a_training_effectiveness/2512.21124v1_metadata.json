  "summary": "A shortcoming of black-box supervised learning models is their lack of interpretability or transparency. To facilitate interpretation, post-hoc global variable importance measures (VIMs) are widely used to assign to each predictor or input variable a numerical score that represents the extent to which that predictor impacts the fitted model's response predictions across the training data. It is well known that the most common existing VIMs, namely marginal Shapley and marginal permutation-based "
