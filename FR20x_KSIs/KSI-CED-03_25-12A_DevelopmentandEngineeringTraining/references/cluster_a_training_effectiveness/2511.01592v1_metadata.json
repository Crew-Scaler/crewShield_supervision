  "summary": "Energy estimation is critical to impact identification on aerospace composites, where low-velocity impacts can induce internal damage that is undetectable at the surface. Current methodologies for energy prediction are often constrained by data sparsity, signal noise, complex feature interdependencies, non-linear dynamics, massive design spaces, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. This study introduces a physics-informed framework that embeds domain knowledge into machine learning t"
