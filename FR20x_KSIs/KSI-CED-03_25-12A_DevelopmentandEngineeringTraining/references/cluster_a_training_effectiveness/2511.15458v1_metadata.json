  "summary": "In physical-layer security schemes, radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification of WiFi devices is susceptible to receiver differences, which can significantly degrade classification performance when a model is trained on one receiver but tested on another. In this paper, we propose a division-based receiver-agnostic RFF extraction method for WiFi systems, which removes the receivers' effects by dividing different preambles in the frequency domain. The proposed method requires only a single"
