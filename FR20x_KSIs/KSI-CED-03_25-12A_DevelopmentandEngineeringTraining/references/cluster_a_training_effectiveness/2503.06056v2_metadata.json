  "summary": "In histopathology, intelligent diagnosis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is essential for automating and objectifying diagnoses, reducing the workload of pathologists. However, diagnostic models often face the challenge of forgetting previously learned data during incremental training on datasets from different sources. To address this issue, we propose a new framework PaGMIL to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in breast cancer WSI classification. Our framework introduces two key components into th"
