  "summary": "Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area.
