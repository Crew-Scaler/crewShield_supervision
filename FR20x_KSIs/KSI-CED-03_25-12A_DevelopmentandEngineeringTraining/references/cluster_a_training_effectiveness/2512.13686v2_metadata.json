  "summary": "As processor designs grow more complex, verification remains bottlenecked by slow software simulation and low-quality random test stimuli. Recent research has applied software fuzzers to hardware verification, but these rely on semantically blind random mutations that may generate shallow, low-quality stimuli unable to explore complex behaviors. These limitations result in slow coverage convergence and prohibitively high verification costs. In this paper, we present Lyra, a heterogeneous RISC-V "
