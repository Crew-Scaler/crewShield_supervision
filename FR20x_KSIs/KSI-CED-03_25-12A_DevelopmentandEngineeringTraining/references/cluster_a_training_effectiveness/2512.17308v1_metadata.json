  "summary": "Strategic decision-making in Pok\u00e9mon battles presents a unique testbed for evaluating large language models. Pok\u00e9mon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pok\u00e9mon battle system where LLMs"
