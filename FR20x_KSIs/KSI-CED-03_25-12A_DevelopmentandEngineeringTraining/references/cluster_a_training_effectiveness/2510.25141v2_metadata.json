  "summary": "Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable photorealism, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish real images from generated ones, raising significant privacy and security concerns. In response, we present a key finding: structural edits enhance the reconstruction of real images while degrading that of generated images, creating a distinctive edit-induced reconstruction error shift. This asymmetric shift enhances the separability between real and generated images. Building on this"
