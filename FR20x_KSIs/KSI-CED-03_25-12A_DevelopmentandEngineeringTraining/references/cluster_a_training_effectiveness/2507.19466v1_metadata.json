  "summary": "Mixed Reality (MR) technologies such as Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR, AR) are well established in medical practice, enhancing diagnostics, treatment, and education. However, there are still some limitations and challenges that may be overcome thanks to the latest generations of equipment, software, and frameworks based on eXtended Reality (XR) by enabling immersive systems that support safer, more controlled environments for training and patient care. Our review highlights recent VR and AR "
