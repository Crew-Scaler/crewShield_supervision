  "summary": "We participated in track 2 of the VoiceMOS Challenge 2024, which aimed to predict the mean opinion score (MOS) of singing samples. Our submission secured the first place among all participating teams, excluding the official baseline. In this paper, we further improve our submission and propose a novel Pitch-and-Spectrum-aware Singing Quality Assessment (PS-SQA) method. The PS-SQA is designed based on the self-supervised-learning (SSL) MOS predictor, incorporating singing pitch and spectral infor"
