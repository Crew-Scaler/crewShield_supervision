  "summary": "This paper critically examines the conceptual and methodological limitations underlying the current understanding and application of VO2max in exercise science and physical activity prescription. Despite the establishment of WHO guidelines on physical activity, population-level adherence remains low. A key contributing factor is the continued reliance on VO2max as a central measure of physical fitness - an index that represents statistical relationships within large populations that provides lim"
