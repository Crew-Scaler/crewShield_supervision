  "summary": "This study investigates AI integration in architectural education through a teaching experiment in Zhejiang University's 2024-25 grade three undergraduate design studio. Adopting a dual-module framework (20-hour AI training + embedded ethics discussions), the course introduced deep learning models, LLMs, AIGC, LoRA, and ComfyUI while maintaining the original curriculum structure, supported by dedicated technical instructors. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of phased guidance, balanced tec"
