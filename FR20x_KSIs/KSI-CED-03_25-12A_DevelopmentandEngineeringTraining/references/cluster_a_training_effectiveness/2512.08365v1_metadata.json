  "summary": "The training and deployment of machine learning (ML) models have become extremely energy-intensive. While existing optimization efforts focus primarily on hardware energy efficiency, a significant but overlooked source of inefficiency is software energy waste caused by poor software design. This often includes redundant or poorly designed operations that consume more energy without improving performance. These inefficiencies arise in widely used ML frameworks and applications, yet developers oft"
