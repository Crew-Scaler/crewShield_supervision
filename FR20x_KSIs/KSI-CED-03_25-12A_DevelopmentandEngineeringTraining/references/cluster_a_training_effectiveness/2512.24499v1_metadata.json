  "summary": "The rapid expansion of generative AI has normalized large-scale synthetic media creation, enabling new forms of covert communication. Recent generative steganography methods, particularly those based on diffusion models, can embed high-capacity payloads without fine-tuning or auxiliary decoders, creating significant challenges for detection and remediation. Coverless diffusion-based techniques are difficult to counter because they generate image carriers directly from secret data, enabling attac"
