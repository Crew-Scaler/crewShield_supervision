  "summary": "Data has been regarded as a valuable asset with the fast development of artificial intelligence technologies. In this paper, we introduce deep-learning neural network-based frequency-domain watermarking for protecting energy system time series data assets and secure data authenticity when being shared or traded across communities. First, the concept and desired watermarking characteristics are introduced. Second, a deep-learning neural network-based watermarking model with specially designed los"
