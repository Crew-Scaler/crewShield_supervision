  "summary": "Edge computing pushes computation closer to data sources, but it also expands the attack surface on resource-constrained devices. This work explores the deployment of the Lightweight Deep Anomaly Detection for Network Traffic (LDPI) integrated as an isolated service within a virtualization framework that provides security by separation. LDPI, adopting a Deep Learning approach, achieved strong training performance, reaching AUC 0.999 (5-fold mean) across the evaluated packet-window settings (n, l"
