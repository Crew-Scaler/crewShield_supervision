  "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT), with its high degree of interconnectivity and limited computational resources, is particularly vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been extensively studied to enhance IoT security, and machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) show considerable promise for detecting malicious activity. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by poor adaptability to emerging threats and the issue of catastrophic forgetting during co"
