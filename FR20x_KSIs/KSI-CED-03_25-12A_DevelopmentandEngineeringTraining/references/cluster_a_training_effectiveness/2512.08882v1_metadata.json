  "summary": "The rise of space AI is reshaping government and industry through applications such as disaster detection, border surveillance, and climate monitoring, powered by massive data from commercial and governmental low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Federated satellite learning (FSL) enables joint model training without sharing raw data, but suffers from slow convergence due to intermittent connectivity and introduces critical trust challenges--where biased or falsified updates can arise across satelli"
