  "summary": "Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel "
