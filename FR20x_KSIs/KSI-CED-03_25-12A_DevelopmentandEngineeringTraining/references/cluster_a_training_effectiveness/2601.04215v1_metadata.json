  "summary": "Our systematisation of knowledge on Social Engineering Attacks (SEAs), identifies the human, organisational, and adversarial dimensions of cyber threats. It addresses the growing risks posed by SEAs, highly relevant in the context physical cyber places, such as travellers at airports and residents in smart cities, and synthesizes findings from peer reviewed studies, industry and government reports to inform effective countermeasures that can be embedded into future smart city strategies.
