  "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are transforming chemical research, yet few formal courses are tailored to synthetic and experimental chemists, who often face steep entry barriers due to limited coding experience and lack of chemistry-specific examples. We present the design and implementation of AI4CHEM, an introductory data-driven chem-istry course created for students on the synthetic chemistry track with no prior programming background. The curricu-lum emphasizes chemical conte"
