  "summary": "Reliable 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild image collections is often hindered by \"noisy\" images-irrelevant inputs with little or no view overlap with others. While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., "
