  "summary": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an efficient method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and is widely adopted within the open-source community. However, the decentralized dissemination of LoRA adapters through platforms such as Hugging Face introduces novel security vulnerabilities: malicious adapters can be easily distributed and evade conventional oversight mechanisms. Despite these risks, backdoor attacks targeting LoRA-based fine-tuning remain relatively underexplored. Exi"
