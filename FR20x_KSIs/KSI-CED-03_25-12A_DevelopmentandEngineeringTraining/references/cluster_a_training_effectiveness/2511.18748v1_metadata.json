  "summary": "The digitalization of substations enlarges the cyber-attack surface, necessitating effective detection and mitigation of cyber attacks in digital substations. While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-bas"
