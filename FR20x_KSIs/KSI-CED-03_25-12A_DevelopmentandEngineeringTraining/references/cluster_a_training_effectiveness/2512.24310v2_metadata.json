  "summary": "Large-scale pre-training is fundamental for generalization in language and vision models, but data for dexterous hand manipulation remains limited in scale and diversity, hindering policy generalization. Limited scenario diversity, misaligned modalities, and insufficient benchmarking constrain current human manipulation datasets. To address these gaps, we introduce World In Your Hands (WiYH), a large-scale open-source ecosystem for human-centric manipulation learning. WiYH includes (1) the Oracl"
