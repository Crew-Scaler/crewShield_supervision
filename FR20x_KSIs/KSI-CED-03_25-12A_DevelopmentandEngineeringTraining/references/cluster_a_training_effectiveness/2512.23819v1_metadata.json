  "summary": "Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evalua"
