  "summary": "We investigate two representation alternatives for the controllers of teams of cyber agents. We combine these controller representations with different evolutionary algorithms, one of which introduces a novel LLM-supported mutation operator. Using a cyber security scenario, we evaluate agent learning when one side is trained to compete against a side that does not evolve and when two sides coevolve with each other. This allows us to quantify the relative merits and tradeoffs of representation an"
