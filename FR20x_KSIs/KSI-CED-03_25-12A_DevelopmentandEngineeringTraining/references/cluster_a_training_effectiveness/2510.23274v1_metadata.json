  "summary": "While semantic communication (SemCom) improves transmission efficiency by focusing on task-relevant information, it also raises critical privacy concerns. Many existing secure SemCom approaches rely on restrictive or impractical assumptions, such as favorable channel conditions for the legitimate user or prior knowledge of the eavesdropper's model. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel secure SemCom framework for image transmission over wiretap channels, leveraging differenti"
