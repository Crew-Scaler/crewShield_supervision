  "summary": "Performance in face and speaker verification is largely driven by margin-based softmax losses such as CosFace and ArcFace. Recently introduced $\u03b1$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly due to their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $\u03b1&gt;1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find that this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities"
