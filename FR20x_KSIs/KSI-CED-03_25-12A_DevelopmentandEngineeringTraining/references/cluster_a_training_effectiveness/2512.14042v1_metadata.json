  "summary": "The patterns of different financial data sources vary substantially, and accordingly, investors exhibit heterogeneous cognition behavior in information processing. To capture different patterns, we propose a novel approach called the two-stage dynamic stacking ensemble model based on investor knowledge representations, which aims to effectively extract and integrate the features from multi-source financial data. In the first stage, we identify different financial data property from global stock "
