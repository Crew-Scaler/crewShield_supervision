  "summary": "Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healt"
