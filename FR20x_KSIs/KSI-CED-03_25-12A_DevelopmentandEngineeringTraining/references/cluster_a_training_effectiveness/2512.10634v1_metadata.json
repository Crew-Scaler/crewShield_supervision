  "summary": "Fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, operating in higher frequency bands from 3 to 300 GHz, provide unprecedented bandwidth to enable ultra-high data rates and low-latency services. However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of mil"
