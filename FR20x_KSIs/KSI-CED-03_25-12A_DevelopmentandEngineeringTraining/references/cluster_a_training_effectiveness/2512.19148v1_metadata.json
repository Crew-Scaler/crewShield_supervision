  "summary": "We present a cross robot visuomotor learning framework that integrates diffusion policy based control with 3D semantic scene representations from D3Fields to enable category level generalization in manipulation. Its modular design supports diverse robot camera configurations including UR5 arms with Microsoft Azure Kinect arrays and bimanual manipulators with Intel RealSense sensors through a low latency control stack and intuitive teleoperation. A unified configuration layer enables seamless swi"
