  "summary": "The increasing operational reliance on complex Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) across safety-critical domains necessitates rigorous adversarial robustness assessment. Modern MAS are inherently heterogeneous, integrating conventional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with emerging Large Language Model (LLM) agent architectures utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A critical shared vulnerability is reliance on centralized memory components: the shared Experience Replay (ER) buffer in "
