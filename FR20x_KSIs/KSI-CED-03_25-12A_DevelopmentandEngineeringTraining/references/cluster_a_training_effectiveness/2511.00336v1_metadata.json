  "summary": "The rapid growth of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices has resulted in significant security risks, particularly the risk of malware attacks on resource-constrained devices. Conventional deep learning methods are impractical due to resource limitations, while Federated Learning (FL) suffers from high communication overhead and vulnerability to non-IID (heterogeneous) data. In this paper, we propose a split learning (SL) based framework for IoT malware detection through image-based classifi"
