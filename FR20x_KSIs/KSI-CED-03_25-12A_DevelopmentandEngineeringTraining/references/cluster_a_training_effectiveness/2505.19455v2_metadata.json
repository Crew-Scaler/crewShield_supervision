  "summary": "Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs) has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal pro"
