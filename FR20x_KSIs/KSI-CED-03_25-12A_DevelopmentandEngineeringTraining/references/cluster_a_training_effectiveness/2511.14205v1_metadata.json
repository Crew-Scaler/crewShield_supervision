  "summary": "We propose FreeMusco, a motion-free framework that jointly learns latent representations and control policies for musculoskeletal characters. By leveraging the musculoskeletal model as a strong prior, our method enables energy-aware and morphology-adaptive locomotion to emerge without motion data. The framework generalizes across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, where distinct energy-efficient strategies naturally appear--for example, quadrupedal gaits in Chimanoid versus bipedal ga"
