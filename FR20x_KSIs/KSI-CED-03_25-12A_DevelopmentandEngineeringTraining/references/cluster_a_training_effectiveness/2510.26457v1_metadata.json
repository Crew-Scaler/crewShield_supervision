  "summary": "Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase. To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly advanced the capabilities of automat"
