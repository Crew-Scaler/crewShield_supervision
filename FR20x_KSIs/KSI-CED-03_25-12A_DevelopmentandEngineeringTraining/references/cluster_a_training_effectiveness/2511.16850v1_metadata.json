  "summary": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes of baryonic matter in the Universe, offering constraints on cosmological and feedback parameters through their extragalactic dispersion measure-redshift (DM$_\\mathrm{exgal}$-$z$) relation. However, the observed FRB population is shaped by complex selection effects arising from instrument sensitivity, DM-dependent search efficiency, and FRB source population redshift-evolution. In this work, we quantify the impact of such observational and "
