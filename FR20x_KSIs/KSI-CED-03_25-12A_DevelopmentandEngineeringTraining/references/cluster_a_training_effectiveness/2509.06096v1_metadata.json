  "summary": "Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies, however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential"
