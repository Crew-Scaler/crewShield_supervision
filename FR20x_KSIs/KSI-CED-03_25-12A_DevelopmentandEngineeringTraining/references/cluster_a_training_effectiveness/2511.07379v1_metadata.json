  "summary": "Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as financial forecasting, recommendation systems, and fraud detection. However, their susceptibility to poisoning attacks poses a critical security risk. We introduce LoReTTA (Low Resource Two-phase Temporal Attack), a novel adversarial framework on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs, which degrades TGNN performance by an average of 29.47% across 4 widely benchmark datasets and 4 State-of-the-Art (SotA) models."
