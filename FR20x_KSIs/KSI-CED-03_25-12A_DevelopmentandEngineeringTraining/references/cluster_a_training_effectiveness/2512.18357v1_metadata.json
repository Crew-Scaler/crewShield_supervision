  "summary": "Acronym Disambiguation (AD) is a fundamental challenge in technical text processing, particularly in specialized sectors where high ambiguity complicates automated analysis. This paper addresses AD within the context of the TextMine'26 competition on French railway documentation. We present DACE (Dynamic Prompting, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Contextual Selection, and Ensemble Aggregation), a framework that enhances Large Language Models through adaptive in-context learning and external doma"
