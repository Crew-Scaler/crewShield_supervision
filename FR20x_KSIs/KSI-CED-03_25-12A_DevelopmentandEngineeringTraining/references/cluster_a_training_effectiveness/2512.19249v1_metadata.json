  "summary": "Searching for fleeting radio transients like fast radio bursts (FRBs) with wide-field radio telescopes has become a common challenge in data-intensive science. Conventional algorithms normally cost enormous time to seek candidates by finding the correct dispersion measures, of which the process is so-called dedispersion. Here we present a novel scheme to identify FRB signals from raw data without dedispersion using Machine Learning (ML). Under the data environment for multibeam receivers, we tra"
