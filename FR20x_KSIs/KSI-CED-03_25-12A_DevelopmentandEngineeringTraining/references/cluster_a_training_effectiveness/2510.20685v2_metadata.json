  "summary": "Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic, open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object categories while avoiding catastrophic forge"
