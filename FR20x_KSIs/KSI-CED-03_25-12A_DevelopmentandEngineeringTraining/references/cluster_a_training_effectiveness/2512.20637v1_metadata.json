  "summary": "Network traffic classification, particularly elephant flow detection, faces significant challenges when deployed across heterogeneous network environments. While existing approaches demonstrate high accuracy within single domains, they suffer from poor generalization due to domain shift phenomena. This paper presents a unified machine learning framework for cross domain elephant flow detection that incorporates application aware and security features to enhance robustness across diverse network "
