  "summary": "This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQ"
