  "summary": "Rail transportation success depends on efficient maintenance to avoid delays and malfunctions, particularly in rural areas with limited resources. We propose a cost-effective wireless monitoring system that integrates sensors and machine learning to address these challenges. We developed a secure data management system, equipping train cars and rail sections with sensors to collect structural and environmental data. This data supports Predictive Maintenance by identifying potential issues before"
