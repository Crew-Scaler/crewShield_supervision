  "summary": "A white paper submitted to the 2025 NASA Decadal Astrobiology Research and Exploration Strategy (DARES) on the importance of early-career training, support, and retention. The paper identifies two goals for NASA Astrobiology regarding early career researchers (ECRs): (1) Knowledge Retention and Workforce Stability, and (2) Foster Collaboration &amp; Strengthen Community. The paper outlines the challenges of achieving these goals and offers recommendations for actions that NASA Astrobiology can t"
