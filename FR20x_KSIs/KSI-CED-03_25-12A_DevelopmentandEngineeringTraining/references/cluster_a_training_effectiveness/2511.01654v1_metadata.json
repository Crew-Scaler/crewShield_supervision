  "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have marked significant impact in traffic state prediction, social recommendation, knowledge-aware question answering and so on. As more and more users move towards cloud computing, it has become a critical issue to unleash the power of GNNs while protecting the privacy in cloud environments. Specifically, the training data and inference data for GNNs need to be protected from being stolen by external adversaries. Meanwhile, the financial cost of cloud computing is a"
