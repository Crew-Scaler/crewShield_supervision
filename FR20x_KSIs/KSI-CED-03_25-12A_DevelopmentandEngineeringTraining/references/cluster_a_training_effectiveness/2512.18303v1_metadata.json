  "summary": "Current cybersecurity research increasingly acknowledges the human factor, yet remains fragmented, often treating user vulnerabilities as isolated and static traits. This paper introduces MORPHEUS, a holistic framework that operationalizes human-centric security as a dynamic and interconnected system. Grounded in the Cognition-Affect-Behavior (CAB) model and Attribution Theory, MORPHEUS consolidates 50 human factors influencing susceptibility to major cyberthreats, including phishing, malware, p"
