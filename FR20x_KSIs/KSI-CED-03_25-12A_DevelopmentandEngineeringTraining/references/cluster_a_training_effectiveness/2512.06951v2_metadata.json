  "summary": "We present a vision-action policy that won 1st place in the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge - a large-scale benchmark featuring 50 diverse long-horizon household tasks in photo-realistic simulation, requiring bimanual manipulation, navigation, and context-aware decision making. Building on the Pi0.5 architecture, we introduce several innovations. Our primary contribution is correlated noise for flow matching, which improves training efficiency and enables correlation-aware inpainting for smooth action s"
