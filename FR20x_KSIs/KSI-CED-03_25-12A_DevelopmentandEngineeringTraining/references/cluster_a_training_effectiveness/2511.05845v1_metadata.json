  "summary": "Recommender systems play a central role in digital platforms by providing personalized content. They often use methods such as collaborative filtering and machine learning to accurately predict user preferences. Although these systems offer substantial benefits, they are vulnerable to security and privacy threats, especially data poisoning attacks. By inserting misleading data, attackers can manipulate recommendations for purposes ranging from boosting product visibility to shaping public opinio"
