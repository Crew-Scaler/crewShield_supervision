  "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy. In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, informa"
