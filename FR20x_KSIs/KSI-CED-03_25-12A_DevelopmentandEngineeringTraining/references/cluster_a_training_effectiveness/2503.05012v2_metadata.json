  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping software development, but their impact across the software development lifecycle is underexplored. Existing work focuses on isolated activities such as code generation or testing, leaving open questions about how LLMs affect developers, processes, products, and the software ecosystem. We address this gap through semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter software professionals who integrated LLM-based tools into their day-to-day work "
