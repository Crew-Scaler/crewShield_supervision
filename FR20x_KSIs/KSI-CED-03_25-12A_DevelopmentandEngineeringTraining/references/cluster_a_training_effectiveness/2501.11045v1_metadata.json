  "summary": "The security requirements for future 6G mobile networks are anticipated to be significantly more complex and demanding than those of 5G. This increase stems from several factors: the proliferation of massive machine-type communications will dramatically increase the density of devices competing for network access; secure ultra-reliable low-latency communication will impose stringent requirements on security, latency, and reliability; and the widespread deployment of small cells and non-terrestri"
