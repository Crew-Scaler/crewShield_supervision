  "summary": "Underground mining operations depend on sensor networks to monitor critical parameters such as temperature, gas concentration, and miner movement, enabling timely hazard detection and safety decisions. However, transmitting raw sensor data to a centralized server for machine learning (ML) model training raises serious privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative by enabling decentralized model training without exposing sensitive local data. Yet, applying "
