  "summary": "Typically, Few-shot Continual Relation Extraction (FCRE) models must balance retaining prior knowledge while adapting to new tasks with extremely limited data. However, real-world scenarios may also involve unseen or undetermined relations that existing methods still struggle to handle. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages the Open Information Extraction concept of Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC). Our method not only exposes models to all possible pairs of r"
