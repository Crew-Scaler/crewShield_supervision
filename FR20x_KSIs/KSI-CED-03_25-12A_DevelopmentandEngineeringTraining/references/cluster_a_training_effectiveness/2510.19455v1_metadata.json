  "summary": "Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, tra"
