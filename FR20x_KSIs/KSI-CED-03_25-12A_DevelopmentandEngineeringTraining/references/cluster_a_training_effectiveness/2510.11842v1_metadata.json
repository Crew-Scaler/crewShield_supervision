  "summary": "Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the interplay between replay ratio config"
