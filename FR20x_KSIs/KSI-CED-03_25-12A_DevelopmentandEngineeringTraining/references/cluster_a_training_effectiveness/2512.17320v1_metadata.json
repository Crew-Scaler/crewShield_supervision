  "summary": "The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) generation has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and copyright violations. Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove target"
