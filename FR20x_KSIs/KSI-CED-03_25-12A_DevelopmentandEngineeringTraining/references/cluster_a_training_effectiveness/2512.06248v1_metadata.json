  "summary": "Code-focused Large Language Models (LLMs), such as CodeX and Star-Coder, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in enhancing developer productivity through context-aware code generation. However, evaluating the quality and security of LLM-generated code remains a significant challenge. Existing evaluation protocols for Code LLMs lack both methodological rigor and comprehensive scope. A key limitation is dataset bias, which arises from unintentional overlap between training and testing data. F"
