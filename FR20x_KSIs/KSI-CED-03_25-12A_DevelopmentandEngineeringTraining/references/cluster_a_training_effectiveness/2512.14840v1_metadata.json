  "summary": "Solar flares are a primary driver of space weather, and forecasting their occurrence remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel flare prediction model based on topologically derived photospheric magnetic parameters. We employ the \\texttt{ARTop} framework to compute the time-dependent input rates of magnetic winding and helicity across more than $10^5$ active region (AR) observations, decomposing them into current-carrying and potential components to reduce sensitivity to optica"
