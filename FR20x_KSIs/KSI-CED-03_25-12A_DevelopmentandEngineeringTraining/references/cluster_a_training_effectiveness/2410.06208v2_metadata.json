  "summary": "In this paper, we propose a physical layer security (PLS) framework for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted integrated sensing and semantic communication (ISASC) system, where a multi-antenna dual-functional semantic base station (BS) serves multiple semantic communication users (SCUs) and monitors a potentially malicious sensing target (MST) in the presence of an eavesdropper (EVE). Both MST and EVE attempt to wiretap information from the signals transmitted to the SCUs. The deploy"
