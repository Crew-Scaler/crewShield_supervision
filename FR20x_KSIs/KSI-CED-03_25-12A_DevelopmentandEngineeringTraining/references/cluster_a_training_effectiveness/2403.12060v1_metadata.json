  "summary": "Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for delivery services is expected to reduce delivery time and human resource costs. However, the proximity of these UAVs to the ground can make them an ideal target for opportunistic criminals. Consequently, UAVs may be hacked, diverted from their destinations, or used for malicious purposes. Furthermore, as a decentralized (peer-to-peer) technology, the blockchain has immense potential to enable secure, decentralized, and cooperative communication amon"
