  "summary": "Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the proce"
