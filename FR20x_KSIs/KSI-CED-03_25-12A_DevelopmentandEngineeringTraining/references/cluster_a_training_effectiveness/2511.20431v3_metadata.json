  "summary": "We propose BRIC, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enables long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies between diffusion-based kinematic motion planners and reinforcement learning-based physics controllers. While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the ph"
