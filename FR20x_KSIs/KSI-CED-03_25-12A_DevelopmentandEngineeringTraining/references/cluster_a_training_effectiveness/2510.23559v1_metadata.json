  "summary": "Accurate detection and classification of nuclei in histopathology images are critical for diagnostic and research applications. We present KongNet, a multi-headed deep learning architecture featuring a shared encoder and parallel, cell-type-specialised decoders. Through multi-task learning, each decoder jointly predicts nuclei centroids, segmentation masks, and contours, aided by Spatial and Channel Squeeze-and-Excitation (SCSE) attention modules and a composite loss function. We validate KongNe"
