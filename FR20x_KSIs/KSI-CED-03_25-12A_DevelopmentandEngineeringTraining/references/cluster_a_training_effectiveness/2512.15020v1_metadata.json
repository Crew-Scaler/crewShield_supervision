  "summary": "Vision-based imitation learning has enabled impressive robotic manipulation skills, but its reliance on object appearance while ignoring the underlying 3D scene structure leads to low training efficiency and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{Implicit Scene Supervision (ISS) Policy}, a 3D visuomotor DiT-based diffusion policy that predicts sequences of continuous actions from point cloud observations. We extend DiT with a novel implicit scene supervision module "
