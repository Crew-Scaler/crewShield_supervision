  "summary": "Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images. The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning. The main contribution of our work resides i"
