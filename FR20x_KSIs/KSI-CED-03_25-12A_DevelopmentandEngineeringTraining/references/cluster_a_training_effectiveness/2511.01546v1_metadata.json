  "summary": "Occluded pedestrian re-identification (ReID) in base station environments is a critical task in computer vision, particularly for surveillance and security applications. This task faces numerous challenges, as occlusions often obscure key body features, increasing the complexity of identification. Traditional ResNet-based ReID algorithms often fail to address occlusions effectively, necessitating new ReID methods. We propose the PCD-ReID (Pedestrian Component Discrepancy) algorithm to address th"
