  "summary": "This paper proposes a rigorous framework to examine the two-way relationship between artificial intelligence (AI), human cognition, problem-solving, and cultural adaptation across academic and business settings. It addresses a key gap by asking how AI reshapes cognitive processes and organizational norms, and how cultural values and institutional contexts shape AI adoption, trust, and use over time. We employ a three-wave longitudinal design that tracks AI knowledge, perceived competence, trust "
