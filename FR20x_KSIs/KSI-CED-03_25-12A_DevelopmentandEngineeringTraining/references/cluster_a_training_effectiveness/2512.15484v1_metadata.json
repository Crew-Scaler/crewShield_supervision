  "summary": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of stellar space weather and can strongly influence the habitability of exoplanets. However, compared to the frequent occurrence of white-light flares, confirmed stellar CMEs remain extremely rare. Whether such flares are commonly accompanied by CMEs is a key question for solar-stellar comparative studies. Using Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray flare light curves observed by the GOES XRS 1--8~\u00c5 channel, we compiled a sample of 1,766 M-class and larger sola"
