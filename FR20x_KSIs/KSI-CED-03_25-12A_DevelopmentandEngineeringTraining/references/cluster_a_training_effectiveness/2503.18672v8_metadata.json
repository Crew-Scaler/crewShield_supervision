  "summary": "With the proliferation of multi-modal data in large-scale visual recognition systems, enabling models to continuously acquire knowledge from evolving data streams while preserving prior information has become increasingly critical. Class-Continual Learning (CCL) addresses this challenge by incrementally incorporating new class knowledge without revisiting historical data, making it essential for real-world big data applications. While traditional CCL methods rely solely on visual features, recen"
