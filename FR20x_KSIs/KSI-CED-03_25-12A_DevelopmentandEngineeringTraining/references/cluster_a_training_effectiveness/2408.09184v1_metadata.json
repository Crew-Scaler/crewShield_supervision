  "summary": "The aim of the work is to present an alternative approach to recording and evaluating student performance that enables sustainable performance recording with the possibility of integrating practical components in particular. The intended result is a digital portfolio with work samples - and not just certificates, which can be understood as a portfolio examination in the context of academic assessment. This is more about the recording, evaluation and certification of learning progress and compete"
