  "summary": "Modern encryption algorithms form the foundation of digital security. However, the widespread use of encryption algorithms results in significant challenges for network defenders in identifying which specific algorithms are being employed. More importantly, we find that when the plaintext distribution of test data departs from the training data, the performance of classifiers often declines significantly. This issue exposes the feature extractor's hidden dependency on plaintext features. To redu"
