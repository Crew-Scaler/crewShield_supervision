  "summary": "Instruction tuning is one of the key steps required for adapting large language models (LLMs) to a broad spectrum of downstream applications. However, this procedure is difficult because real-world datasets are rarely homogeneous; they consist of a mixture of diverse information, causing gradient interference, where conflicting gradients pull the model in opposing directions, degrading performance. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to group data based on semantic or embedding similarit"
