  "summary": "Facial recognition has become a widely used method for authentication and identification, with applications for secure access and locating missing persons. Its success is largely attributed to deep learning, which leverages large datasets and effective loss functions to learn discriminative features. Despite these advances, facial recognition still faces challenges in explainability, demographic bias, privacy, and robustness to aging, pose variations, lighting changes, occlusions, and facial exp"
