  "summary": "As Federated Learning (FL) becomes more widespread, there is growing interest in its decentralized variants. Decentralized FL leverages the benefits of fast and energy-efficient device-to-device communications to obviate the need for a central server. However, this opens the door to new security vulnerabilities as well. While FL security has been a popular research topic, the role of adversarial node placement in decentralized FL remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by evalu"
