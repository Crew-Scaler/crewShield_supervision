  "summary": "Context. GenAI tools are being increasingly adopted by practitioners in SE, promising support for several SE activities. Despite increasing adoption, we still lack empirical evidence on how GenAI is used in practice, the benefits it provides, the challenges it introduces, and its broader organizational and societal implications. Objective. This study aims to provide an overview of the status of GenAI adoption in SE. It investigates the status of GenAI adoption, associated benefits and challenges"
