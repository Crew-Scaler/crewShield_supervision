  "summary": "Studying learning-related plasticity is central to understanding the acquisition of complex skills, for example learning to master a musical instrument. Over the past three decades, conventional group-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have advanced our understanding of how humans' neural representations change during skill acquisition. However, group-based fMRI studies average across heterogeneous learners and often rely on coarse pre- versus post-training comparisons, l"
