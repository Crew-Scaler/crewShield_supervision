  "summary": "Security applications are increasingly relying on large language models (LLMs) for cyber threat detection; however, their opaque reasoning often limits trust, particularly in decisions that require domain-specific cybersecurity knowledge. Because security threats evolve rapidly, LLMs must not only recall historical incidents but also adapt to emerging vulnerabilities and attack patterns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in general LLM applications, but its pote"
