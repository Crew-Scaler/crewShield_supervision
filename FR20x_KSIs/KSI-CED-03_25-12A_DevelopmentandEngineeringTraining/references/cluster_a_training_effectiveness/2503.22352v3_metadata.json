  "summary": "Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing high-quality images from textual prompts. However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to enco"
