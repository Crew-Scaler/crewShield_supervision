  "summary": "Lifelong deep learning (LDL) trains neural networks to learn sequentially across tasks while preserving prior knowledge. We propose Task-Aware Multi-Expert (TAME), a continual learning algorithm that leverages task similarity to guide expert selection and knowledge transfer. TAME maintains a pool of pretrained neural networks and activates the most relevant expert for each new task. A shared dense layer integrates features from the chosen expert to generate predictions. To reduce catastrophic fo"
