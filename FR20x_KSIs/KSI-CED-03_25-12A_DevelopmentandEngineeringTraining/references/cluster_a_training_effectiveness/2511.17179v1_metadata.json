  "summary": "Generative AI is spreading rapidly, creating significant social and economic value while also raising concerns about its high energy use and environmental sustainability. While prior studies have predominantly focused on the energy-intensive nature of the training phase, the cumulative environmental footprint generated during large-scale service operations, particularly in the inference phase, has received comparatively less attention. To bridge this gap this study conducts a scoping review of m"
