  "summary": "Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data. Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds.
