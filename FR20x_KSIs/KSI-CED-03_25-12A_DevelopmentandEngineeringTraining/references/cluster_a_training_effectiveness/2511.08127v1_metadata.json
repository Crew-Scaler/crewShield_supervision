  "summary": "Source Code Model learn the proper embeddings from source codes, demonstrating significant success in various software engineering or security tasks. The recent explosive development of LLM extends the family of SCMs,bringing LLMs for code that revolutionize development workflows. Investigating different kinds of SCM vulnerability is the cornerstone for the security and trustworthiness of AI-powered software ecosystems, however, the fundamental one, transferable vulnerability, remains critically"
