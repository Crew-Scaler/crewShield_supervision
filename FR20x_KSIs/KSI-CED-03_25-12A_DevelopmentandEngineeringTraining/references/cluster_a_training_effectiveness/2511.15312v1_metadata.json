  "summary": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection and aerial object recognition are critical for modern surveillance and security, prompting a need for robust systems that overcome limitations of single-modality approaches. This research addresses these challenges by designing and rigorously evaluating a novel multimodal Transformer model that integrates diverse data streams: radar, visual band video (RGB), infrared (IR) video, and audio. The architecture effectively fuses distinct features from each moda"
