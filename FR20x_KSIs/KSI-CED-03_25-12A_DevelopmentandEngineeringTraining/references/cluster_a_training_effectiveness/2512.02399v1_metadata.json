  "summary": "Smart contracts are a core component of blockchain technology and are widely deployed across various scenarios. However, atomicity violations have become a potential security risk. Existing analysis tools often lack the precision required to detect these issues effectively. To address this challenge, we introduce AtomGraph, an automated framework designed for detecting atomicity violations. This framework leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to identify atomicity violations through multi"
