  "summary": "The proliferation of IoT devices and their reliance on Wi-Fi networks have introduced significant security vulnerabilities, particularly the KRACK and Kr00k attacks, which exploit weaknesses in WPA2 encryption to intercept and manipulate sensitive data. Traditional IDS using classifiers face challenges such as model overfitting, incomplete feature extraction, and high false positive rates, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a "
