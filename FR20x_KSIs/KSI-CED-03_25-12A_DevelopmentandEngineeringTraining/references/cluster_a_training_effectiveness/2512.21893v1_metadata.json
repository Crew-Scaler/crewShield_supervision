  "summary": "Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum computing and quantum information processing tasks. However, its quantification remains a major challenge since it cannot be directly extracted from physical observables. To address this issue, we study a few machine-learning based models to estimate the amount of entanglement in two-qubit as well as three-qubit systems. We use measurement outcomes as the input features and entanglement measures as the training labels. Our models predict entangle"
