  "summary": "Learning fast and robust ball-kicking skills is a critical capability for humanoid soccer robots, yet it remains a challenging problem due to the need for rapid leg swings, postural stability on a single support foot, and robustness under noisy sensory input and external perturbations (e.g., opponents). This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system that enables humanoid robots to execute robust continual ball-kicking with adaptability to different ball-goal configurations. The s"
