  "summary": "The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT) networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist, requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics, interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning (ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO)"
