  "summary": "Actively secure arithmetic MPC is now practical for real applications, but performance and usability are still limited by framework-specific compilation stacks, the need for programmers to explicitly express parallelism, and high communication overhead. We design and implement a proof-of-concept LLVM-based optimization pipeline for the SPDZ protocol that addresses these bottlenecks. Our front end accepts a subset of C with lightweight privacy annotations and lowers it to LLVM IR, allowing us to "
