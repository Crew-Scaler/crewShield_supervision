  "summary": "Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), characterized by impaired regulation of blood flow in the coronary microcirculation, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and is increasingly recognized as a contributor to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Despite its clinical importance, CMD remains underdiagnosed due to the reliance on invasive procedures such as pressure wire-based measurements of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR),"
