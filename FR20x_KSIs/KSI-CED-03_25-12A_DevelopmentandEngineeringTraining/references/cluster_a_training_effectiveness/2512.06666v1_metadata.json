  "summary": "Time series classification faces a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. While comprehensive ensembles like HIVE-COTE 2.0 achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, their 340-hour training time on the UCR benchmark renders them impractical for large-scale datasets. We investigate whether targeted combinations of two efficient algorithms from complementary paradigms can capture ensemble benefits while maintaining computational feasibility.
