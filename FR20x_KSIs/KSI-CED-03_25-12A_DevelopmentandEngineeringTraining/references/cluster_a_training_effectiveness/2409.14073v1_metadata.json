  "summary": "Integrating Google's Topics API into the digital advertising ecosystem represents a significant shift toward privacy-conscious advertising practices. This article analyses the implications of implementing Topics API on ad networks, focusing on competition dynamics and ad space accessibility. Through simulations based on extensive datasets capturing user behavior and market share data for ad networks, we evaluate metrics such as Ad Placement Eligibility, Low Competition Rate, and solo competitor."
