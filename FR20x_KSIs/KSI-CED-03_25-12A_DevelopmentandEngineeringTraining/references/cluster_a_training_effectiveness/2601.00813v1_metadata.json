  "summary": "The principle of learning from errors is pedagogically powerful but often impractical in industrial settings due to risks to safety and equipment. This paper presents an integrated training approach specifically designed for tufting machine operators. It uses hybrid digital twins, augmented reality (AR), and Petri Net-based modelling to apply the learning from errors principle effectively. Operator actions and errors are simulated via experimentable digital twins (EDTs), and the consequences of "
