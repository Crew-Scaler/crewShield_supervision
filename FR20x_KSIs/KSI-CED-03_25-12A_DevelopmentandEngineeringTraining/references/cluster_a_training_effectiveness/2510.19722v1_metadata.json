  "summary": "Spatial statistics often rely on Gaussian processes (GPs) to capture dependencies across locations. However, their computational cost increases rapidly with the number of locations, potentially needing multiple hours even for moderate sample sizes. To address this, we propose using Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (SIVI), a highly flexible Bayesian approximation method, for scalable Bayesian spatial interpolation. We evaluated SIVI with a GP prior and a Nearest-Neighbour Gaussian Process (NNG"
