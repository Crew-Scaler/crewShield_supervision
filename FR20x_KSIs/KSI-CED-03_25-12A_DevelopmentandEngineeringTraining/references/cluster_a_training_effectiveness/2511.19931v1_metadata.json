  "summary": "Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) has been proposed to enrich user-item interactions by incorporating information from various domains. Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross"
