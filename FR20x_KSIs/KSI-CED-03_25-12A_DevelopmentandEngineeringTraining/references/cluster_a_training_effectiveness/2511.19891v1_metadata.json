  "summary": "Phase-Based Ranging (PBR) offers several advantages for estimating distances between wirelessly connected devices, including high accuracy over large distances and the removal of the need for antenna arrays at each transceiver. This study investigates the use of Neural Network (NN)-based models for accurate PBR in three distinct environments: Openfield, Office, and Near Buildings, comparing their performance with established non-NN methods. A novel 2NN Model is proposed, integrating two neural n"
