  "summary": "Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes R"
