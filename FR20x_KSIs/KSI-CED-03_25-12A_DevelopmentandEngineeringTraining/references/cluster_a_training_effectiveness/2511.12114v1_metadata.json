  "summary": "In the era of information explosion, Recommender Systems (RS) are essential for alleviating information overload and providing personalized user experiences. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative recommenders have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of user preferences. These approaches explore a broader range of user interests by progressively perturbing the distribution of user-item interactions and recovering potential preferences from noise, enabling nuanced behavioral unde"
