  "summary": "Recurrent exacerbations remain a common yet preventable outcome for many children with asthma. Machine learning (ML) algorithms using electronic medical records (EMR) could allow accurate identification of children at risk for exacerbations and facilitate referral for preventative comprehensive care to avoid this morbidity. We developed ML algorithms to predict repeat severe exacerbations (i.e. asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits or future hospital admissions) for children with a pri"
