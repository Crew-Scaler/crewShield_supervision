  "summary": "Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them"
