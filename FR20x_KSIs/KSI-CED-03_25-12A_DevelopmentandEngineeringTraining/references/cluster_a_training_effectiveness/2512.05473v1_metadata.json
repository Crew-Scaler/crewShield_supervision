  "summary": "Although distributed Gaussian process regression (GPR) enables multiple agents with separate datasets to jointly learn a model of the target function, its collaborative nature poses risks of private data leakage. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving fully distributed GPR protocol based on secure multi-party computation (SMPC) that preserves the confidentiality of each agent's local dataset. Building upon a secure distributed average consensus algorithm, the protocol guarantees that e"
