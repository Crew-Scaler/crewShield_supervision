  "summary": "Indias linguistic diversity poses significant challenges for developing inclusive Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Traditional multilingual models, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical due to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual Learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages sequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge. This paper investigates CL for ASR on India"
