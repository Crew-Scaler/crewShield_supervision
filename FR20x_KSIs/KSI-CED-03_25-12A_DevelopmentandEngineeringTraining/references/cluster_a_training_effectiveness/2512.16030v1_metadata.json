  "summary": "A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\\% confidence, it should be correct 80\\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \\textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutof"
