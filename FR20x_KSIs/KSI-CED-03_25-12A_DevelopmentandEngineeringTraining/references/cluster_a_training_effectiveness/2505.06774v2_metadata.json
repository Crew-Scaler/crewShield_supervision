  "summary": "In this paper, we present a framework for modeling quantum recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their enhanced version, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks using the core ideas presented by Linden et al. (2009), where the entangling and disentangling power of unitary transformations is investigated. In particular, we interpret entangling and disentangling power as information retention and forgetting mechanisms in LSTMs. Thus, entanglement emerges as a key component of the optimization (train"
