  "summary": "In the realm of computer security, the importance of efficient and reliable user authentication methods has become increasingly critical. This paper examines the potential of mouse movement dynamics as a consistent metric for continuous authentication. By analyzing user mouse movement patterns in two contrasting gaming scenarios, \"Team Fortress\" and Poly Bridge we investigate the distinctive behavioral patterns inherent in high-intensity and low-intensity UI interactions. The study extends beyon"
