  "published": "2025-12-26T00:44:07Z",
  "summary": "Log parsing converts log messages into structured event templates, allowing for automated log analysis and reducing manual inspection effort. To select the most compatible parser for a specific system, multiple evaluation metrics are commonly used for performance comparisons. However, existing evaluation metrics heavily rely on labeled log data, which limits prior studies to a fixed set of datasets and hinders parser evaluations and selections in the industry. Further, we discovered that differe",
