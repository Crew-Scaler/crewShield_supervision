  "title": "Prismatic World Model: Learning Compositional Dynamics for Planning in Hybrid Systems",
  "published": "2025-12-09T09:40:34Z",
  "summary": "Model-based planning in robotic domains is fundamentally challenged by the hybrid nature of physical dynamics, where continuous motion is punctuated by discrete events such as contacts and impacts. Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizo",
