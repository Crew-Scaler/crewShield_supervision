  "published": "2025-12-05T22:52:22Z",
  "summary": "This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration",
