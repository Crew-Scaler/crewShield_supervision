  "title": "Phase-OTDR Event Detection Using Image-Based Data Transformation and Deep Learning",
  "published": "2025-12-05T15:52:40Z",
  "summary": "This study focuses on event detection in optical fibers, specifically classifying six events using the Phase-OTDR system. A novel approach is introduced to enhance Phase-OTDR data analysis by transforming 1D data into grayscale images through techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field, Gramian Angular Summation Field, and Recurrence Plot. These grayscale images are combined into a multi-channel RGB representation, enabling more robust and adaptable analysis using transfer learning model",
