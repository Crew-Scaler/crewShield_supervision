  "title": "NuBench: An Open Benchmark for Deep Learning-Based Event Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes",
  "published": "2025-11-17T08:08:01Z",
  "summary": "Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light.
