  "summary": "Generative models augmented with external tools and update mechanisms (or \\textit{agents}) have demonstrated capabilities beyond intelligent prompting of base models. As agent use proliferates, dynamic multi-agent systems have naturally emerged. Recent work has investigated the theoretical and empirical properties of low-dimensional representations of agents based on query responses at a single time point. This paper introduces the Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS), which jointly em",
