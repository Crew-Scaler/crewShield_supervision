  "summary": "Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist ra",
