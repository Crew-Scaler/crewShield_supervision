  "published": "2025-11-17T04:26:56Z",
  "summary": "Multivariate time series classification is increasingly investigated in space weather research as a means to predict intense solar flare events, which can cause widespread disruptions across modern technological systems. Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare comp",
