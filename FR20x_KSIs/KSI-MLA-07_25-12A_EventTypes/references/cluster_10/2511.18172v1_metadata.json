  "summary": "Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is a crucial component of particle physics experiments and ensures that the recorded data is of the highest quality, and suitable for subsequent physics analysis. Due to the extreme environmental conditions, unprecedented data volumes, and the sheer scale and complexity of the detectors, DQM orchestration has become a very challenging task. Therefore, the use of Machine Learning (ML) to automate anomaly detection, improve efficiency, and reduce human error in the pr",
