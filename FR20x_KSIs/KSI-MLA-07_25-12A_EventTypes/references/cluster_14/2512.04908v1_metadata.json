  "title": "Logic-Driven Cybersecurity: A Novel Framework for System Log Anomaly Detection using Answer Set Programming",
  "published": "2025-12-04T15:37:32Z",
  "summary": "This study explores the application of Answer Set Programming (ASP) for detecting anomalies in system logs, addressing the challenges posed by evolving cyber threats. We propose a novel framework that leverages ASP's declarative nature and logical reasoning capabilities to encode complex security rules as logical predicates. Our ASP-based system was applied to a real-world Linux system log dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying various anomalies such as potential brute-force att",
