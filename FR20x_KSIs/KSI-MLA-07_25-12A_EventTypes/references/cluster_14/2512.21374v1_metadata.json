  "title": "Security Risks Introduced by Weak Authentication in Smart Home IoT Systems",
  "published": "2025-12-24T14:07:22Z",
  "summary": "Smart home IoT systems rely on authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized entities can control devices and access sensitive functionality. In practice, these mechanisms must balance security with usability, often favoring persistent connectivity and minimal user interaction. This paper presents an empirical analysis of authentication enforcement in deployed smart home IoT devices, focusing on how authentication state is established, reused, and validated during normal operation and",
