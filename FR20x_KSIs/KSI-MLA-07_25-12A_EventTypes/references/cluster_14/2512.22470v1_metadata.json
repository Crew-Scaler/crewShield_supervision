  "published": "2025-12-27T05:05:46Z",
  "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \\textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM out",
