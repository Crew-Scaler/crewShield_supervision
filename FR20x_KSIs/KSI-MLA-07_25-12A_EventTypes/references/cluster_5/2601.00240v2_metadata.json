  "title": "When Agents See Humans as the Outgroup: Belief-Dependent Bias in LLM-Powered Agents",
  "published": "2026-01-01T07:18:36Z",
  "summary": "This paper reveals that LLM-powered agents exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias under minimal \"us\" versus \"them\" cues. When such group boundaries align with the agent-human divide, a new bias risk emerges: agents may treat other AI agents as the ingroup and humans as the outgroup. To examine this risk, we conduct a controlled multi-agent social simulation and find that agents display consistent intergroup bias in an all-agent setting. More criticall",
