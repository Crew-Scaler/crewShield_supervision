  "summary": "The deployment of traditional deep learning models in high-risk security tasks in an unlabeled, data-non-exploitable video intelligence environment faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a lightweight anomaly detection framework based on color features for surveillance video clips in a high sensitivity tactical mission, aiming to quickly identify and interpret potential threat events under resource-constrained and data-sensitive conditions. The method fuses unsupervised KMeans c",
