  "summary": "Living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques pose a significant challenge to security operations, exploiting legitimate tools to execute malicious commands that evade traditional detection methods. To address this, we present a robust augmentation framework for cyber defense systems as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions, enabling the detection of LOTL attacks such as reverse shells through machine learning. Leveraging real-world threat intelligence and adversarial training, our ",
