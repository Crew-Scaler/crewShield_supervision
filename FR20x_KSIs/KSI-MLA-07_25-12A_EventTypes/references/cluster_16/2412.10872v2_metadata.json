  "published": "2024-12-14T15:56:13Z",
  "summary": "Efficient defense against dynamically evolving advanced persistent threats (APT) requires the structured threat intelligence feeds, such as techniques used. However, existing threat-intelligence extraction techniques predominantly focuses on individual pieces of intelligence-such as isolated techniques or atomic indicators-resulting in fragmented and incomplete representations of real-world attacks. This granularity inherently limits on both the depth and the contextual richness of the extracted",
