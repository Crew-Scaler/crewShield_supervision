  "summary": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely employed to detect and mitigate external network security events. Vehicle ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) continue to evolve, especially with developments related to Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this study, we explore the detection of cyber threats in vehicle networks through ensemble-based machine learning, to strengthen the performance of the learnt model compared to relying on a single model. We propose a model that uses Random Forest and CatB",
