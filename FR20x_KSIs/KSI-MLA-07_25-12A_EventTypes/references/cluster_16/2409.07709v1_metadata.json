  "summary": "Many organizations rely on Threat Intelligence (TI) feeds to assess the risk associated with security threats. Due to the volume and heterogeneity of data, it is prohibitive to manually analyze the threat information available in different loosely structured TI feeds. Thus, there is a need to develop automated methods to vet and extract actionable information from TI feeds. To this end, we present a machine learning pipeline to automatically detect vulnerability exploitation from TI feeds. We fi",
