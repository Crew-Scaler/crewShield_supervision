  "summary": "The valuation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) remains a persistent challenge due to the problem of negative evidence: successful threat prevention results in non-events that generate minimal observable financial impact, making CTI expenditures difficult to justify within traditional cost-benefit frameworks.
