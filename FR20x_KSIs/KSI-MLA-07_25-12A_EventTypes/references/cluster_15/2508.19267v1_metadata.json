  "title": "The Aegis Protocol: A Foundational Security Framework for Autonomous AI Agents",
  "published": "2025-08-22T06:18:57Z",
  "summary": "The proliferation of autonomous AI agents marks a paradigm shift toward complex, emergent multi-agent systems. This transition introduces systemic security risks, including control-flow hijacking and cascading failures, that traditional cybersecurity paradigms are ill-equipped to address. This paper introduces the Aegis Protocol, a layered security framework designed to provide strong security guarantees for open agentic ecosystems. The protocol integrates three technological pillars: (1) non-sp",
