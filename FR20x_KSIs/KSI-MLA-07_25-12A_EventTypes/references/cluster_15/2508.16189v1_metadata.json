  "published": "2025-08-22T08:11:23Z",
  "summary": "The very high growth of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has generated an urgent requirement for secure, effective, and context-aware data sharing mechanisms, especially over heterogeneous and geographically dispersed settings. This work suggests a new architecture that combines a relay chain-driven encryption system with a modified Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme to tackle the double impediment of dynamic access and low-latency communication. The model propo",
