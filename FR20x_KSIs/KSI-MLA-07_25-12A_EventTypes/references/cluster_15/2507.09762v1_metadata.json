  "title": "EventHunter: Dynamic Clustering and Ranking of Security Events from Hacker Forum Discussions",
  "published": "2025-07-13T19:40:36Z",
  "summary": "Hacker forums provide critical early warning signals for emerging cybersecurity threats, but extracting actionable intelligence from their unstructured and noisy content remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and prioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach leverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to group related discussions into distinct security eve",
