  "summary": "Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on \"perception-representation,\" Reinforcement Learning on \"decision-making-behavior,\" and Symbolic AI on \"knowledge-reasoning.\" With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop \"perception-decision-action\" capabilities.\n  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential re",
