  "published": "2026-01-04T09:52:41Z",
  "summary": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) represents a significant shift in the 6G landscape, where wireless networks both sense the environment and communicate. While prior comprehensive surveys have established foundational elements of ISAC security, discussed perception-focused security models, and proposed layered defense strategies, this paper synthesizes these studies into a comprehensive taxonomic framework that covers the whole ISAC security domain. This paper provides a systematic and",
