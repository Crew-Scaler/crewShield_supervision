  "summary": "Autonomous AI agents executing multi-step tool sequences face semantic attacks that manifest in behavioral traces rather than isolated prompts. A critical challenge is cross-attack generalization: can detectors trained on known attack families recognize novel, unseen attack types? We discover that standard conversational tokenization -- capturing linguistic patterns from agent interactions -- fails catastrophically on structural attacks like tool hijacking (AUC 0.39) and data exfiltration (AUC 0",
