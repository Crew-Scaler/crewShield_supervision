  "summary": "In recent years, cyberattacks - along with physical faults - have become an increasing factor causing system failures, especially in DER (Distributed Energy Resources) systems. In addition, according to the literature, a number of faults have been reported to remain undetected. Consequently, unlike anomaly detection works that only identify abnormalities, differentiating undetected faults and cyberattacks is a challenging task. Although several works have studied this problem, they crucially fal",
