  "published": "2026-01-05T09:31:21Z",
  "summary": "Software vulnerability detection is a critical task for securing software systems and can be formulated as a binary classification problem: given a code snippet, determine whether it contains a vulnerability. Existing multimodal approaches typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations from pretrained language models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations from graph neural networks, often under the implicit assumption that adding a modality necessarily yields extra informatio",
