  "title": "Driver-Intention Prediction with Deep Learning: Real-Time Brain-to-Vehicle Communication",
  "published": "2026-01-08T16:29:08Z",
  "summary": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and electronics without the need for speech or physical movement. Such interfaces can be particularly beneficial in applications requiring rapid response times, such as driving, where a vehicle's advanced driving assistance systems could benefit from immediate understanding of a driver's intentions. This study presents a novel method for predicting a driver's intention to steer using electroencephalography (EEG) signal",
