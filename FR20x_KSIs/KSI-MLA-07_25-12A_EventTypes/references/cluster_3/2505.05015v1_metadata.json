  "title": "An Agent-Based Modeling Approach to Free-Text Keyboard Dynamics for Continuous Authentication",
  "published": "2025-05-08T07:42:05Z",
  "summary": "Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience. This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data from five unique agents, capturing fe",
