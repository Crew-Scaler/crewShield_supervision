  "title": "Secure Physical Layer Communications for Low-Altitude Economy Networking: A Survey",
  "published": "2025-04-12T09:36:53Z",
  "summary": "The Low-Altitude Economy Networking (LAENet) is emerging as a transformative paradigm that enables an integrated and sophisticated communication infrastructure to support aerial vehicles in carrying out a wide range of economic activities within low-altitude airspace. However, the physical layer communications in the LAENet face growing security threats due to inherent characteristics of aerial communication environments, such as signal broadcast nature and channel openness. These challenges hig",
