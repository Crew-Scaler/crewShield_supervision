  "title": "Where the Devil Hides: Deepfake Detectors Can No Longer Be Trusted",
  "published": "2025-05-13T06:09:34Z",
  "summary": "With the advancement of AI generative techniques, Deepfake faces have become incredibly realistic and nearly indistinguishable to the human eye. To counter this, Deepfake detectors have been developed as reliable tools for assessing face authenticity. These detectors are typically developed on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and trained using third-party datasets. However, this protocol raises a new security risk that can seriously undermine the trustfulness of Deepfake detectors: Once the third-par",
