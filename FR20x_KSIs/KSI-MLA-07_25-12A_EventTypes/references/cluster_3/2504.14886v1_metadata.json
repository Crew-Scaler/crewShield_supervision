  "title": "Zero Day Malware Detection with Alpha: Fast DBI with Transformer Models for Real World Application",
  "published": "2025-04-21T06:30:21Z",
  "summary": "The effectiveness of an AI model in accurately classifying novel malware hinges on the quality of the features it is trained on, which in turn depends on the effectiveness of the analysis tool used. Peekaboo, a Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) tool, defeats malware evasion techniques to capture authentic behavior at the Assembly (ASM) instruction level. This behavior exhibits patterns consistent with Zipf's law, a distribution commonly seen in natural languages, making Transformer models par",
