  "published": "2025-03-17T01:01:10Z",
  "summary": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous robotic agents for conducting online transactions poses significant cybersecurity challenges. This study aims to enforce robust cybersecurity constraints to mitigate the risks associated with data breaches, transaction fraud, and system manipulation. The background focuses on the rise of LLM-driven robotic systems in e-commerce, finance, and service industries, alongside the vulnerabilities they introduce. A novel security architect",
