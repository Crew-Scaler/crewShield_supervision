  "published": "2025-10-28T10:31:39Z",
  "summary": "Financial fraud detection is critical for maintaining the integrity of financial systems, particularly in decentralised environments such as cryptocurrency networks. Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as Graph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture, which mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for static graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networ",
