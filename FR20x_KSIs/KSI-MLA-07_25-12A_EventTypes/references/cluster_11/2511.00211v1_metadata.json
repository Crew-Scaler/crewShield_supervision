  "summary": "The increasing adoption of satellite Internet with low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites in mega-constellations allows ubiquitous connectivity to rural and remote areas. However, weather events have a significant impact on the performance and reliability of satellite Internet. Adverse weather events such as snow and rain can disturb the performance and operations of satellite Internet's essential ground terminal components, such as satellite antennas, significantly disrupting the space-ground link co",
