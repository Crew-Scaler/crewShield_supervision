  "summary": "Respiratory sounds captured via auscultation contain critical clues for diagnosing pulmonary conditions. Automated classification of these sounds faces challenges due to subtle acoustic differences and severe class imbalance in clinical datasets. This study investigates respiratory sound classification with a focus on mitigating pronounced class imbalance. We propose a hybrid deep learning model that combines a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential feature encoding with a Kolmogor",
