  "title": "Beyond Fact Retrieval: Episodic Memory for RAG with Generative Semantic Workspaces",
  "published": "2025-11-10T19:59:34Z",
  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval ",
