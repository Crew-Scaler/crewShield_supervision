  "published": "2025-11-01T13:18:50Z",
  "summary": "Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities i",
