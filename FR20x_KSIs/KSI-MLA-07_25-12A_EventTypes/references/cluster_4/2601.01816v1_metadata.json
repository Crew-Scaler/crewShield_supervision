  "summary": "This paper introduces Admissibility Alignment: a reframing of AI alignment as a property of admissible action and decision selection over distributions of outcomes under uncertainty, evaluated through the behavior of candidate policies. We present MAP-AI (Monte Carlo Alignment for Policy) as a canonical system architecture for operationalizing admissibility alignment, formalizing alignment as a probabilistic, decision-theoretic property rather than a static or binary condition.\n  MAP-AI, a new c",
