  "summary": "Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements ",
