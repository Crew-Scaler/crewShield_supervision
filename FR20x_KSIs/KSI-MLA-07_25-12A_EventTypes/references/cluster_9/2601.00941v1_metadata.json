  "summary": "Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics and exposomics aim to measure detectable small molecules in biological samples. The results facilitate hypothesis-generating discovery of metabolic changes and disease mechanisms and provide information about environmental exposures and their effects on human health. Metabolomics and exposomics are made possible by the high resolving power of LC and high mass measurement accuracy of MS. However, a majority of the signals from suc",
