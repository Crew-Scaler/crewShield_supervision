  "summary": "Large Language Models have become integral to software development, yet they frequently generate vulnerable code. Existing code vulnerability detection benchmarks employ binary classification, lacking the CWE-level specificity required for actionable feedback in iterative correction systems. We present ALPHA (Adaptive Learning via Penalty in Hierarchical Assessment), the first function-level Python benchmark that evaluates both LLMs and SAST tools using hierarchically aware, CWE-specific penalti",
