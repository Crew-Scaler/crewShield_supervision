  "title": "Democratizing ML for Enterprise Security: A Self-Sustained Attack Detection Framework",
  "published": "2025-12-09T16:58:08Z",
  "summary": "Despite advancements in machine learning for security, rule-based detection remains prevalent in Security Operations Centers due to the resource intensiveness and skill gap associated with ML solutions. While traditional rule-based methods offer efficiency, their rigidity leads to high false positives or negatives and requires continuous manual maintenance. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid framework to democratize ML-based threat detection. The first stage employs intentionally loos",
