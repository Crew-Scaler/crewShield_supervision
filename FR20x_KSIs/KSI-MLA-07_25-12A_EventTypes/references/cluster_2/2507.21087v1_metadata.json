  "title": "Intelligent ARP Spoofing Detection using Multi-layered Machine Learning (ML) Techniques for IoT Networks",
  "published": "2025-06-23T20:26:56Z",
  "summary": "Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing remains a critical threat to IoT networks, enabling attackers to intercept, modify, or disrupt data transmission by exploiting ARP's lack of authentication. The decentralized and resource-constrained nature of IoT environments amplifies this vulnerability, making conventional detection mechanisms ineffective at scale. This paper introduces an intelligent, multi-layered machine learning framework designed to detect ARP spoofing in real-time IoT deploymen",
