  "title": "CANDoSA: A Hardware Performance Counter-Based Intrusion Detection System for DoS Attacks on Automotive CAN bus",
  "published": "2025-07-19T20:09:52Z",
  "summary": "The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, essential for automotive embedded systems, lacks inherent security features, making it vulnerable to cyber threats, especially with the rise of autonomous vehicles. Traditional security measures offer limited protection, such as payload encryption and message authentication. This paper presents a novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed for the CAN environment, utilizing Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) to detect anomalies indicative of cybe",
