  "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as passwords is not. Generating passwords that mim",
