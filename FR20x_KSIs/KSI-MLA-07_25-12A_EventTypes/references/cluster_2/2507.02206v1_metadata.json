  "summary": "True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used, they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs. In this work, we propose a novel and",
