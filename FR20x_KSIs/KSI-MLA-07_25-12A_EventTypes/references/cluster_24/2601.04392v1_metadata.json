  "summary": "This paper introduces a fuzzy reinforcement learning framework, Enhanced-FQL($\u03bb$), that integrates novel Fuzzified Eligibility Traces (FET) and Segmented Experience Replay (SER) into fuzzy Q-learning with Fuzzified Bellman Equation (FBE) for continuous control tasks. The proposed approach employs an interpretable fuzzy rule base instead of complex neural architectures, while maintaining competitive performance through two key innovations: a fuzzified Bellman equation with eligibility traces for ",
