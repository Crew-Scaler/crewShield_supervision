  "published": "2026-01-07T23:20:19Z",
  "summary": "Raman spectroscopy is a key tool for graphene characterization, yet its application to graphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) is strongly limited by the intense and variable second-order Raman response of the substrate. This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experi",
