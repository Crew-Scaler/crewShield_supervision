  "summary": "High-stakes decision domains are increasingly exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex decision-making tasks. However, LLM deployment in real-world settings presents challenges in data security, evaluation of its capabilities outside controlled environments, and accountability attribution in the event of adversarial decisions. This paper proposes a framework for responsible deployment of LLM-based decision-support systems through active human involvement. It integrates",
