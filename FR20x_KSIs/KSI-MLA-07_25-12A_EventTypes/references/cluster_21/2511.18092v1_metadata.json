  "title": "Event-Chain Analysis for Automated Driving and ADAS Systems: Ensuring Safety and Meeting Regulatory Timing Requirements",
  "published": "2025-11-22T15:22:05Z",
  "summary": "Automated Driving Systems (ADS), including Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), must fulfill not only high functional expectations but also stringent timing constraints mandated by international regulations and standards. Regulatory frameworks such as UN regulations, NCAP standards, ISO norms, and NHTSA guidelines impose strict bounds on system reaction times to ensure safe vehicle operation. This paper presents a structured, White-Box methodology based on Event-Chain Modeling to address t",
