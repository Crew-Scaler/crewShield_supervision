  "title": "Critical appraisal of artificial intelligence for rare-event recognition: principles and pharmacovigilance case studies",
  "published": "2025-10-05T20:05:38Z",
  "summary": "Many high-stakes AI applications target low-prevalence events, where apparent accuracy can conceal limited real-world value. Relevant AI models range from expert-defined rules and traditional machine learning to generative LLMs constrained for classification. We outline key considerations for critical appraisal of AI in rare-event recognition, including problem framing and test set design, prevalence-aware statistical evaluation, robustness assessment, and integration into human workflows.
