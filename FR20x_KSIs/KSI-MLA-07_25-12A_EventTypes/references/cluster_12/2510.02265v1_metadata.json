  "title": "How to Combat Reactive and Dynamic Jamming Attacks with Reinforcement Learning",
  "published": "2025-10-02T17:44:38Z",
  "summary": "This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for discrete jamming-event states,",
