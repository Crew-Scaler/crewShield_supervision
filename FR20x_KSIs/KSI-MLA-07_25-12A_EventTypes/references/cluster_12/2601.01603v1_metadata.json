  "published": "2026-01-04T17:04:52Z",
  "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive study of matrix Kloosterman sums, including their computational aspects, distributional behavior, and applications in cryptographic analysis. Building on the work of [Zelingher, 2023], we develop algorithms for evaluating these sums via Green's polynomials and establish a general framework for analyzing their statistical distributions. We further investigate the associated $L$-functions and clarify their relationships with symmetric functions and random matrix",
