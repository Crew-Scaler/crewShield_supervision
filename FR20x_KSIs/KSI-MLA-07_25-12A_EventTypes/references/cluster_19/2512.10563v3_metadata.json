  "title": "NormCode: A Semi-Formal Language for Auditable AI Planning",
  "published": "2025-12-11T11:50:50Z",
  "summary": "As AI systems move into high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical diagnosis, and financial decision making, regulators and practitioners increasingly demand auditability. Auditability means the ability to trace exactly what each step in a multi step workflow saw and did. Current large language model based workflows are fundamentally opaque. Context pollution, defined as the accumulation of information across reasoning steps, causes models to hallucinate and lose track of constraints. ",
