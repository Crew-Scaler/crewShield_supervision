  "title": "Cloud Security Leveraging AI: A Fusion-Based AISOC for Malware and Log Behaviour Detection",
  "published": "2025-12-16T21:56:11Z",
  "summary": "Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) enable cloud governance, risk and compliance by providing insights visibility and control. Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets. In this research, we implement an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) on AWS that combines cloud-native instrumentation with ML-based detection. The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. ",
