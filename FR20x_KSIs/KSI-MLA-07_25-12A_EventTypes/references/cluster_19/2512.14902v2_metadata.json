  "title": "How frontier AI companies could implement an internal audit function",
  "published": "2025-12-16T20:36:58Z",
  "summary": "Frontier AI developers operate at the intersection of rapid technical progress, extreme risk exposure, and growing regulatory scrutiny. While a range of external evaluations and safety frameworks have emerged, comparatively little attention has been paid to how internal organizational assurance should be structured to provide sustained, evidence-based oversight of catastrophic and systemic risks. This paper examines how an internal audit function could be designed to provide meaningful assurance",
