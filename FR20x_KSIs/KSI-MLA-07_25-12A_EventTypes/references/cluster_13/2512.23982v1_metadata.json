  "published": "2025-12-30T04:39:59Z",
  "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms in software development, including vibe coding, AI-assisted coding, and agentic coding, fundamentally reshaping how software is designed, implemented, and maintained. Prior research has primarily examined AI-based coding at the individual level or in educational settings, leaving industrial practitioners' perspectives underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in profess",
