  "title": "Towards eco friendly cybersecurity: machine learning based anomaly detection with carbon and energy metrics",
  "published": "2025-12-31T14:36:57Z",
  "summary": "The rising energy footprint of artificial intelligence has become a measurable component of US data center emissions, yet cybersecurity research seldom considers its environmental cost. This study introduces an eco aware anomaly detection framework that unifies machine learning based network monitoring with real time carbon and energy tracking. Using the publicly available Carbon Aware Cybersecurity Traffic Dataset comprising 2300 flow level observations, we benchmark Logistic Regression, Random",
