  "published": "2026-01-03T03:14:40Z",
  "summary": "Out-of-band screening of microcontrollers is a major gap in semiconductor supply chain security. High-assurance techniques such as X-ray and destructive reverse engineering are accurate but slow and expensive, hindering comprehensive detection for hardware Trojans or firmware tampering. Consequently, there has been increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to automate forensic examination, enabling rapid, large-scale inspection of components without manual oversight. We introduc",
