12. 2408.02946 - Scaling Trends for Data Poisoning in LLMs
    Focus: 24 LLMs (1.5B to 72B parameters)
    Key: LARGER models MORE vulnerable to poisoning (counter-intuitive)

CROSS-CUTTING INSIGHTS
-----------------------
- Latency-Accuracy Tradeoff is Fundamental (Papers 1, 3, 4, 5)
- Adversarial Drift ≠ Natural Drift (Papers 6, 7, 8)
- Scale Creates Vulnerability (Papers 10, 11, 12)
- Research-Practice Gap on Metrics (Paper 3)
