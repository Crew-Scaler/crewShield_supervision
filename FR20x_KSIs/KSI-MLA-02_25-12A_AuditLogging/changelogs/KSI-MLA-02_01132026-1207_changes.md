**Data Source:** Synthesized from 64 research papers on AI-driven audit logging (2024-2025), refined per issue #35 guidance on scope alignment
**Filtering Criteria:** Questions directly addressing AI activity logging, data integrity defense, immutable forensics, container/ephemeral logging constraints, log injection/corruption defense, and compliance automation. Excluded questions on data poisoning training integrity (moved to separate KSI), model drift detection (moved to separate KSI), multi-tenant isolation policy (moved to separate KSI), and governance/investment (moved to separate KSI).

**Research Synthesis:** 64 papers synthesized into focused clusters for MLA-02 scope: Real-Time Detection (5 papers: millisecond latency, fusion models, false alarm reduction), Log Injection (4 papers: log4shell-style attacks, injection via unsanitized input, SIEM rule mapping), Immutable Trails (6 papers: Nitro 30x faster <2% loss, blockchain-IPFS hybrid 87% cost reduction, quantum-resistant cryptography), Container Logging (5 papers: 10x-100x volume, 98% loss without eBPF, sidecar patterns), Compliance Evidence (4 papers: RuleGenie SIEM optimization, ML continuous auditing, explainable AI). Key metrics integrated: 98% log loss vs. <2% eBPF-based, 30x faster logging, 85.77% poisoning detection (for baseline learning protection context), 91% undetectable degradation (for baseline drift monitoring relevance). Critical focus: AI-specific event capture (inference, agent decisions, training access) with forensic immutability guarantees.

**Note on Scope Refinement:** Per issue #35 guidance, the following question clusters have been moved to separate KSIs for better domain alignment:
- **Data Poisoning & Training Integrity Questions (5 questions)** → Moved to Data Poisoning KSI (covers training data validation, poisoning detection, Byzantine-resilient aggregation, implicit poisoning in logs, clean data validation)
- **Model Drift & Runtime Monitoring Questions (4 questions)** → Moved to Model Drift KSI (covers baseline degradation, concept drift distinction, baseline poisoning in learning phase, MTTD for degradation)
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation & Cross-Tenant Leakage Questions (5 questions)** → Moved to Multi-Tenant Isolation KSI (covers cryptographic isolation, inference attacks, incident response access, shared infrastructure leakage, customer communication)
- **Governance, Metrics & Investment Questions (3 questions)** → Moved to Governance & Investment KSI (covers governance evolution, KPI measurement/reporting, cost-benefit analysis)

This refinement ensures MLA-02 maintains tight focus on AI-specific audit logging architecture, NHI governance, log immutability, injection defense, and compliance evidence generation—the core technical logging and forensics capabilities for AI systems.
