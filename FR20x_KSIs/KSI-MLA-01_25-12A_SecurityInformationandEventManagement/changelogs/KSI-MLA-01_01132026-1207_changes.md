**Data Source:** Synthesized from 173 research papers on AI-enhanced SIEM (2023-2025) + cross-referenced with KSI-MLA-08 Log Data Access
**Filtering Criteria:** Questions directly addressing AI/agent-specific SIEM capabilities, defenses against adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model drift, agentic response governance, and compliance automation. Removed: supply chain provenance (Q22→moved), blockchain anchoring (Q28→moved), compliance framework catalogs (Q30→moved), FedRAMP automation (Q33→moved), executive KPIs (Q39→moved), capability roadmaps (Q40→moved). Consolidated: behavioral baselines Q6/Q9/Q10→Q5/Q6; training pipeline Q4/Q21/Q24/Q25→Q17; cryptographic integrity Q26/Q27/Q29→Q19. Added: cross-linked integrity questions from KSI-MLA-08 (Q27-Q29 addressing non-repudiation, cross-org validation, forensic detection). Total: 29 focused discovery questions for MLA-01 core competency areas (including 3 cross-linked from MLA-08 Log Data Access).

**Research Synthesis:** 173 papers synthesized into 11 thematic clusters organized in 4 implementation tiers: Tier 1 Foundational (2 clusters: Log Normalization, Anomaly Detection with Integrity); Tier 2 Detection/Response (3 clusters: Agent Control, LLM Injection, Adversarial Evasion); Tier 3 Operations (3 clusters: Supply Chain Monitoring, Multi-Tenant Isolation, Real-Time Correlation at Scale); Tier 4 Hardening/Compliance (3 clusters: Adversarial Resilience, Data Poisoning Defense, Behavioral Baselines with Compliance). Key quantified findings integrated: 99.2% ransomware containment achievable with AI SIEM, 10-50x MTTR improvement, 40-70% alert reduction, 18-minute ransomware breakout vs 8+ hour baseline, 80-95% adversarial evasion success against traditional detection, 22-27% accuracy degradation from data poisoning, 15-20% resilience gain from ensemble approaches, 85.77% concept drift detection with explainability, 91% of ML systems degrade undetected, 75% of organizations lack drift monitoring. Critical gap: Organizations deploying AI-enhanced SIEM lack comprehensive defense-in-depth against multi-stage attacks spanning data poisoning, prompt injection, baseline evasion, and agentic compromise. Architecture transformation required from reactive rule-based detection to proactive AI-native detection with forensic immutability and governance automation.
