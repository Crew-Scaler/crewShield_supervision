# AI-Enhanced SIEM: Log Normalization, Anomaly Detection & Agentic Response: Discovery Questions

**KSI Focus:** MLA-01 - Architect AI-enhanced Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for Cloud Service Providers enabling real-time threat detection, autonomous incident response, and compliance-grade forensic integrity. Achieve 99.2% ransomware containment and 10-50x MTTR improvement through LLM-driven log normalization, behavioral baselines with cryptographic integrity, agentic orchestration, and defense against adversarial evasion attacks. Move beyond traditional rule-based SIEM to AI-native detection integrating anomaly detection ensembles, automated response, and forensic immutability while defending against prompt injection, data poisoning, model extraction, and agent compromise.

**Context:** Organizations deploying AI-enhanced SIEM face fundamental architectural challenges: LLM-based log normalization (40-70% alert reduction) introduces prompt injection attack surface (80-95% undefended); behavioral baselines enable insider threat detection but suffer concept drift within 30 days; autonomous response agents dramatically reduce MTTR (5-15 minutes vs. 8+ hours) but become insider threats if compromised. Research synthesis of 173 papers across 11 clusters reveals multi-tier architecture requirements: Tier 1 (foundational normalization/integrity), Tier 2 (detection/response with adversarial resilience), Tier 3 (operations at scale), Tier 4 (hardening/compliance). Critical discovery questions validate: (a) LLM normalization security (prompt injection defense, hallucination detection), (b) behavioral baseline robustness (concept drift detection, adversarial resistance), (c) agentic response governance (human oversight, privilege constraints), (d) data poisoning defense (training pipeline integrity, model robustness), (e) compliance evidence (explainability, forensic immutability, GDPR/NIST/FedRAMP alignment). Quantified research findings: 99.2% ransomware containment possible with AI-native detection; 40-70% alert reduction through intelligent filtering; 80-95% adversarial evasion success against traditional detection; 22-27% accuracy degradation from data poisoning; 91% of ML models degrade undetected without monitoring; 85.77% concept drift detection possible with explainable systems.
