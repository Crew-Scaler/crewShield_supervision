  "summary": "Anonymous credentials (ACs) are a crucial cryptographic tool for privacy-preserving authentication in decentralized networks, allowing holders to prove eligibility without revealing their identity. However, a major limitation of standard ACs is the disclosure of the issuer's identity, which can leak sensitive contextual information about the holder. Issuer-hiding ACs address this by making a credential's origin indistinguishable among a set of approved issuers. Despite this advancement, existing",
