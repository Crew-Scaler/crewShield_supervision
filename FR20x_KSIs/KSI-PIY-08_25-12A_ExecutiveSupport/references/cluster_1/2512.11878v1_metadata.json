  "summary": "Decentralized AI systems, such as federated learning, can play a critical role in further unlocking AI asset marketplaces (e.g., healthcare data marketplaces) thanks to increased asset privacy protection. Unlocking this big potential necessitates governance mechanisms that are transparent, scalable, and verifiable. However current governance approaches rely on bespoke, infrastructure-specific policies that hinder asset interoperability and trust among systems. We are proposing a Technical Policy",
