  "summary": "Offline Licensing is a mechanism for compute governance that could be used to prevent unregulated training of potentially dangerous frontier AI models. The mechanism works by disabling AI chips unless they have an unused license from a regulator. In this report, we present a design for a minimal version of Offline Licensing that could be delivered via a firmware update. Existing AI chips could potentially support Offline Licensing within a year if they have the following (relatively common) hard",
