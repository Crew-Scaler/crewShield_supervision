The goal is to enable Identity Providers (IdPs) to detect duplicate or fraudulent identity enrollments without revealing users personal data or enabling cross-domain correlation. The protocol relies on Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) combined with domain-specific transformations, ensuring that each IdP generates independent pseudonymous identifiers der",
