  "summary": "Generative and agentic artificial intelligence is entering financial markets faster than existing governance can adapt. Current model-risk frameworks assume static, well-specified algorithms and one-time validations; large language models and multi-agent trading systems violate those assumptions by learning continuously, exchanging latent signals, and exhibiting emergent behavior. Drawing on complex adaptive systems theory, we model these technologies as decentralized ensembles whose risks propa",
