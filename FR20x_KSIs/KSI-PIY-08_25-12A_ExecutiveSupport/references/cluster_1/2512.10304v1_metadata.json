  "summary": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence",
