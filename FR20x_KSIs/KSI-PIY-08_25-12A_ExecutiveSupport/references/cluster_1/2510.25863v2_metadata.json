  "summary": "This paper introduces the Agentic AI Governance Assurance & Trust Engine (AAGATE), a Kubernetes-native control plane designed to address the unique security and governance challenges posed by autonomous, language-model-driven agents in production. Recognizing the limitations of traditional Application Security (AppSec) tooling for improvisational, machine-speed systems, AAGATE operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). It integrates specialized security frameworks for each R",
