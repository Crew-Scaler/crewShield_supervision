  "summary": "The integration of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) in healthcare presents both unprecedented opportunities and challenges, necessitating innovative regulatory approaches. GenAI and LLMs offer broad applications, from automating clinical workflows to personalizing diagnostics. However, the non-deterministic outputs, broad functionalities and complex integration of GenAI and LLMs challenge existing medical device regulatory frameworks, including the total product life cycle ",
