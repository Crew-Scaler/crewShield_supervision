  "summary": "Urban mobility data are indispensable for urban planning, transportation demand forecasting, pandemic modeling, and many other applications; however, individual mobile phone-derived Global Positioning System traces cannot generally be shared with third parties owing to severe re-identification risks. Aggregated records, such as origin-destination (OD) matrices, offer partial insights but fail to capture the key behavioral properties of daily human movement, limiting realistic city-scale analyses",
