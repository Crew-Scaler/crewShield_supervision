  "summary": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling computational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent probabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and hybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent reliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This research offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning (TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliabil",
