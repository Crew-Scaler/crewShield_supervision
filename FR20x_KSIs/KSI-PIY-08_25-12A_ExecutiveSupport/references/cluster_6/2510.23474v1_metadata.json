  "summary": "Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test, compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) ",
