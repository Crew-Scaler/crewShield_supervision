  "summary": "While NVIDIA remains the dominant provider of AI accelerators within cloud data center, emerging vendors such as AMD, Intel, Mac, and Huawei offer cost-effective alternatives with claims of compatibility and performance. This paper presents the first empirical study investigating divergence in machine learning model across heterogeneous AI accelerators. Utilizing an automated pipeline, we synthesize over 100,000 variant models derived from 4,000 real-world models and execute them across five dif",
