  "summary": "Length control in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial but under-addressed challenge, with applications ranging from voice interfaces requiring concise responses to research summaries needing comprehensive outputs. Current approaches to length control, including Regularized DPO, Length-Instruction Fine Tuning, and tool-augmented methods, typically require expensive model retraining or complex inference-time tooling. This paper presents a prompt engineering methodology that enables precise l",
