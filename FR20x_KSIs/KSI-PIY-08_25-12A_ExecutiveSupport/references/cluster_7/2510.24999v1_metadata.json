  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting significant investments in training data, compute, and expertise. Deploying these models on partially trusted or insecure devices introduces substantial risk of model theft, making it essential to design inference protocols with provable security guarantees.\n  We present the formal framework and security foundations of SLIP, a hybrid inference protocol that splits model computation between a trusted and an unt",
