  "summary": "Modern cloud-native systems increasingly rely on multi-cluster deployments to support scalability, resilience, and geographic distribution. However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven fr",
