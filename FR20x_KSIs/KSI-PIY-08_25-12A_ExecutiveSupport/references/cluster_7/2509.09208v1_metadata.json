  "summary": "Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in suboptimal training performance. To address th",
