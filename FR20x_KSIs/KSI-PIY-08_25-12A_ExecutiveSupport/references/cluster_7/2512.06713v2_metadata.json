  "summary": "Current LLM-based text anonymization frameworks usually rely on remote API services from powerful LLMs, which creates an inherent privacy paradox: users must disclose data to untrusted third parties for guaranteed privacy preservation. Moreover, directly migrating current solutions to local small-scale models (LSMs) offers a suboptimal solution with severe utility collapse. Our work argues that this failure stems not merely from the capability deficits of LSMs, but significantly from the inheren",
