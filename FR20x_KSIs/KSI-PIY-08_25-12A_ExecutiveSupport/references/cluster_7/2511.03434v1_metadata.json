  "summary": "As the \"agentic web\" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered) autonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to protocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 \"Trustless Agents,\" yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design",
