  "summary": "In modern engineering practice, human engineers collaborate in specialized teams to design complex products, with each expert completing their respective tasks while communicating and exchanging results and data with one another. While this division of expertise is essential for managing multidisciplinary complexity, it demands substantial development time and cost. Recently, we introduced OpenFOAMGPT (1.0, 2.0), which functions as an autonomous AI engineer for computational fluid dynamics, and ",
