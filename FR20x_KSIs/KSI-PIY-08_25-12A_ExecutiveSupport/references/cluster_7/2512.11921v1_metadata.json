  "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation,enabling robots to execute natural language commands through end-to-end learning from visual observations.However, deploying large-scale VLA models on affordable robotic platforms remains challenging due to computational constraints and the need for efficient adaptation to new robot embodiments. This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning methodology and real-world deployment analysis for adapt",
