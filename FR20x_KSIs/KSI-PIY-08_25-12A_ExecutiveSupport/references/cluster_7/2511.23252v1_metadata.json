  "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach to collaboratively train machine learning models without centralizing raw data, yet its scalability is often throttled by excessive communication overhead. This challenge is magnified in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices face stringent bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Conventional secure aggregation protocols, while essential for protecting model updates, frequently require multiple interaction rounds, large payloa",
