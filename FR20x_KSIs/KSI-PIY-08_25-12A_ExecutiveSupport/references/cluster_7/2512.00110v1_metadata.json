  "summary": "Constant-size cryptographic evidence records are increasingly used to build audit trails for regulated AI workloads in clinical, pharmaceutical, and financial settings, where each execution is summarized by a compact, verifiable record of code identity, model version, data digests, and platform measurements. Existing instantiations, however, typically rely on classical signature schemes whose long-term security is threatened by quantum-capable adversaries. In this paper we formalize security not",
