  "summary": "Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities and are analyzed by experts as well as automated systems, such as static analysis and AI-assisted solutions. However, audit artifacts are heterogeneous and often lack reproducible, executable PoC tests suitable for automated validation, leading to costly, ad hoc manual verification. Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to turn audit reports into PoC test cases, but have three major challenges: noisy inputs, hallucinations, and missing runtime",
