  "summary": "The increasing deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices in modern smart grid environments requires secure and efficient communication protocols specifically designed for resource-constrained environments. However, most existing authentication schemes either impose excessive computational overhead or lack robustness against advanced cyber threats, making them unsuitable for resource-limited smart grid deployments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight auth",
