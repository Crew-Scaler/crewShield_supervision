  "summary": "Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and",
