  "summary": "As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundari",
