  "summary": "The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic, unique signature (a \"fingerprint\") and comparing it to that of a source model to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods often fail to generate distinctive",
