  "summary": "Adversarial smart contracts, mostly on EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum and BSC, are deployed as EVM bytecode to exploit vulnerable smart contracts for financial gain. Detecting such malicious contracts at the time of deployment is an important proactive strategy to prevent losses from victim contracts. It offers a better cost-benefit ratio than detecting vulnerabilities on diverse potential victims. However, existing works are not generic with limited detection types and effectiveness due to",
