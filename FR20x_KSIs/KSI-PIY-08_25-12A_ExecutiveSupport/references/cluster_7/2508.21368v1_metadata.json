  "summary": "The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \\$10 billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and potential misalignment with human values",
