  "summary": "This paper introduces a methodology based on Euclidean information theory to investigate local properties of secure communication over discrete memoryless wiretap channels. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a legitimate user's information rate while imposing explicit upper bounds on both the information leakage to an eavesdropper and the informational cost of encoding the secret message. By leveraging local geometric approximations, this inherently non-convex problem",
