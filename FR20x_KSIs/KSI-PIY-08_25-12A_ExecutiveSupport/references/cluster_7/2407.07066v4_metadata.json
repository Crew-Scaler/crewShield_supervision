  "summary": "Machine Learning (ML) models integrated with in-situ sensing offer transformative solutions for defect detection in Additive Manufacturing (AM), but this integration brings critical challenges in safeguarding sensitive data, such as part designs and material compositions. Differential Privacy (DP), which introduces mathematically controlled noise, provides a balance between data utility and privacy. However, black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) models often obscure how this noise impacts model",
