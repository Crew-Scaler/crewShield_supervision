  "summary": "Another threat is the development of large quantum computers, which have a high likelihood of breaking the high popular security protocols because it can use both Shor and Grover algorithms. In order to fix this looming threat, quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, otherwise known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), are being formulated to protect cybersecurity systems of the future. The current paper presents the state of the art in designing, realizing, and testing the security of robust qu",
