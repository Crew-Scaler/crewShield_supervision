  "summary": "In actuality, phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent cybersecurity risks in existence today, with malevolent actors constantly changing their strategies to successfully trick users. This paper presents an AI model for a phishing detection system that uses an ensemble approach to combine character-level Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LightGBM with engineered features. Our system uses a character-level CNN to extract sequential features after extracting 36 lexical, structural, ",
