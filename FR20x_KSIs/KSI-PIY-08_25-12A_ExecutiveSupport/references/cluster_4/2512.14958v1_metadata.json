  "summary": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has evolved modern transportation through enhanced connectivity and intelligent systems. However, this increased connectivity introduces critical vulnerabilities, making vehicles susceptible to cyber-attacks such Denial-ofService (DoS) and message spoofing. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to classify malicious Controller Area network (CAN) bus traffic using the CiCIoV2024 benchmark dataset. We analyzed various attack",
