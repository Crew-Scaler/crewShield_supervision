  "summary": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box n",
