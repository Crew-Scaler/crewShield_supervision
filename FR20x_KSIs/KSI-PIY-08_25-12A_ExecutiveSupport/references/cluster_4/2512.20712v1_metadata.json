  "summary": "Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitation",
