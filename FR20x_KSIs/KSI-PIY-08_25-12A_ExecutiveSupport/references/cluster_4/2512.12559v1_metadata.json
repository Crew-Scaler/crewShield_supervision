  "summary": "The widespread adoption of open-source ecosystems enables developers to integrate third-party packages, but also exposes them to malicious packages crafted to execute harmful behavior via public repositories such as PyPI. Existing datasets (e.g., pypi-malregistry, DataDog, OpenSSF, MalwareBench) label packages as malicious or benign at the package level, but do not specify which statements implement malicious behavior. This coarse granularity limits research and practice: models cannot be traine",
