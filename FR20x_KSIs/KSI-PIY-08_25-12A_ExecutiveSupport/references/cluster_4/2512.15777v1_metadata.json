  "summary": "Modern computing systems face security threats, including memory corruption attacks, speculative execution vulnerabilities, and control-flow hijacking. Although existing solutions address these threats individually, they frequently introduce performance overhead and leave security gaps. This paper presents a Variable Record Table (VRT) with a unified hardware-assisted framework that simultaneously enforces spatial memory safety against buffer overflows, back-edge control-flow integrity (CFI), an",
