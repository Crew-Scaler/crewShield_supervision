  "summary": "The need for an intelligent, real-time spoilage prediction system has become critical in modern IoT-driven food supply chains, where perishable goods are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage pr",
