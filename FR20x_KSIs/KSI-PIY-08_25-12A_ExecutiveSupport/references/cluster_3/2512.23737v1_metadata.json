  "summary": "Cloud data pipelines increasingly operate under dynamic workloads, evolving schemas, cost constraints, and strict governance requirements. Despite advances in cloud-native orchestration frameworks, most production pipelines rely on static configurations and reactive operational practices, resulting in prolonged recovery times, inefficient resource utilization, and high manual overhead. This paper presents Agentic Cloud Data Engineering, a policy-aware control architecture that integrates bounded",
