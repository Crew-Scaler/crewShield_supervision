  "summary": "Being infinite dimensional, non-parametric information geometry has long faced an \"intractability barrier\" due to the fact that the Fisher-Rao metric is now a functional incurring difficulties in defining its inverse. This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM = S \\oplus S^{\\perp}$), where $S$ represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Ma",
