  "summary": "The integration of the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) in smart greenhouses has revolutionised precision agriculture by enabling efficient and autonomous environmental control. However, existing time series forecasting models in such setups often operate as black boxes, lacking mechanisms for explainable decision-making, which is a critical limitation when trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount in smart farming practices. This study leverages the Temporal Fusion Transform",
