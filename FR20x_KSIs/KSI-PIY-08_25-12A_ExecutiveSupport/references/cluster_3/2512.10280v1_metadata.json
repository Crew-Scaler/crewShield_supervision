  "summary": "The rapid expansion of cloud infrastructures and distributed identity systems has significantly increased the complexity and attack surface of modern enterprises. Traditional rule based or signature driven detection systems are often inadequate in identifying novel or evolving threats within Identity and Access Management logs, where anomalous behavior may appear statistically benign but contextually malicious. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection framework ",
