  "summary": "We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-ch",
