  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent \"Black-Box\" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, ye",
