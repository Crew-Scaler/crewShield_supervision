  "summary": "The rapid expansion of AI-driven applications powered by large language models has led to a surge in AI interaction data, raising urgent challenges in security, accountability, and risk traceability. This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain",
