  "summary": "Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimiz",
