  "summary": "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) programme has become the de facto standard for providing digital forensic tool testing and validation. However to date, no comprehensive framework exists to automate benchmarking across the diverse forensic tasks included in the programme. This gap results in inconsistent validation, challenges in comparing tools, and limited validation reproducibility. This paper introduces AutoDFBench 1.0, a modular",
