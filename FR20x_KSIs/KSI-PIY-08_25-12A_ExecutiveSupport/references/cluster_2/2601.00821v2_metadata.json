  "summary": "Conversation summarization loses nuanced details: when asked about coding preferences after 40 turns, summarization recalls \"use type hints\" but drops the critical constraint \"everywhere\" (19.0% exact match vs. 93.0% for our approach).\n  We present CogCanvas, a training-free framework inspired by how teams use whiteboards to anchor shared memory. Rather than compressing conversation history, CogCanvas extracts verbatim-grounded artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) and retrieves them via tempo",
