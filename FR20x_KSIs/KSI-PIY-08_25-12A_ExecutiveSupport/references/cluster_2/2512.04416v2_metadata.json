  "summary": "Data governance ensures data quality, security, and compliance through policies and standards, a critical foundation for scaling modern AI development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for automating data governance by translating user intent into executable transformation code. However, existing benchmarks for automated data science often emphasize snippet-level coding or high-level analytics, failing to capture the unique challenge of data governance:",
