  "summary": "Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.\n  We propose a new alternative: synthesizing instance-optimal heuristics -- specialized for the exact workloads and hardware",
