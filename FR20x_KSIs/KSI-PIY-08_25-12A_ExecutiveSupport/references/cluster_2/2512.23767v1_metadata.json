  "summary": "Physical AI at the edge -- enabling autonomous systems to understand and predict real-world dynamics in real time -- requires hardware-efficient learning and inference. Model recovery (MR), which identifies governing equations from sensor data, is a key primitive for safe and explainable monitoring in mission-critical autonomous systems operating under strict latency, compute, and power constraints. However, state-of-the-art MR methods (e.g., EMILY and PINN+SR) rely on Neural ODE formulations th",
