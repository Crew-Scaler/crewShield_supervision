  "summary": "We present DASH (Deception-Augmented Shared mental model for Human-machine teaming), a novel framework that enhances mission resilience by embedding proactive deception into Shared Mental Models (SMM). Designed for mission-critical applications such as surveillance and rescue, DASH introduces \"bait tasks\" to detect insider threats, e.g., compromised Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), AI agents, or human analysts, before they degrade team performance. Upon detection, tailored recovery mechanisms ar",
