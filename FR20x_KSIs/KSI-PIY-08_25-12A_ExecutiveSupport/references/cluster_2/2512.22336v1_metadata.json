  "summary": "Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also",
