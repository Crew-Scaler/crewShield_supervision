  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained considerable popularity and protected by increasingly sophisticated safety mechanisms. However, jailbreak attacks continue to pose a critical security threat by inducing models to generate policy-violating behaviors. Current paradigms focus on input-level anomalies, overlooking that the model's internal psychometric state can be systematically manipulated. To address this, we introduce Psychological Jailbreak, a new jailbreak attack paradigm that exposes ",
