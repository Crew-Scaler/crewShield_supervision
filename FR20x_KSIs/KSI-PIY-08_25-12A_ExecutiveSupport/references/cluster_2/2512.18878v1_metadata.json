  "summary": "Automating crash video analysis is essential to leverage the growing availability of driving video data for traffic safety research and accountability attribution in autonomous driving. Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, ",
