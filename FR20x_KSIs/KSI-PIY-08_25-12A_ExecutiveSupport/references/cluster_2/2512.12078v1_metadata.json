  "summary": "Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) encoded in STIX and structured according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework has become a global reference for describing adversary behavior. However, ATT&CK was designed as a descriptive knowledge base rather than a procedural model. We therefore ask whether its structured artifacts contain sufficient behavioral detail to support multi-stage adversary emulation. Through systematic measurements of the ATT&CK Enterprise bundle, we show that campaign objects encode just f",
