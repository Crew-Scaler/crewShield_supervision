  "summary": "Over the past decade, a wide range of motion planning approaches for autonomous vehicles has been developed to handle increasingly complex traffic scenarios. However, these approaches are rarely compared on standardized benchmarks, limiting the assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses. To address this gap, we present the setup and results of the 4th CommonRoad Motion Planning Competition held in 2024, conducted using the CommonRoad benchmark suite. This annual competition provides an open",
