  "summary": "Polymorphic malware continually alters its structure to evade signature-based defences, challenging both commercial antivirus (AV) and enterprise detection systems. This study introduces a reproducible framework for analysing eight polymorphic behaviours-junk code insertion, control-flow obfuscation, packing, data encoding, domain generation, randomized beacon timing, protocol mimicry, and format/header tweaks-and evaluates their detectability across three layers: commercial AVs, custom rule-bas",
