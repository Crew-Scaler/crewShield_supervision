  "summary": "Modern computer systems often rely on syslog, a simple, universal protocol that records every critical event across heterogeneous infrastructure. However, healthcare's rapidly growing clinical AI stack has no equivalent. As hospitals rush to pilot large language models and other AI-based clinical decision support tools, we still lack a standard way to record how, when, by whom, and for whom these AI models are used. Without that transparency and visibility, it is challenging to measure real-worl",
