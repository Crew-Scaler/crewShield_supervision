  "summary": "Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) generate high-frequency, time-synchronized data essential for real-time power grid monitoring, yet the growing scale of PMU deployments creates significant challenges in latency, scalability, and reliability. Conventional centralized processing architectures are increasingly unable to handle the volume and velocity of PMU data, particularly in modern grids with dynamic operating conditions. This paper presents a scalable cloud-native architecture for intelligent P",
