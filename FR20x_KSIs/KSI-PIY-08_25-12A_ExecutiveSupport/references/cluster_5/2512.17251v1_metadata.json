  "summary": "Large language models are exposed to risks of extraction, distillation, and unauthorized fine-tuning. Existing defenses use watermarking or monitoring, but these act after leakage. We design AlignDP, a hybrid privacy lock that blocks knowledge transfer at the data interface. The key idea is to separate rare and non-rare fields. Rare fields are shielded by PAC indistinguishability, giving effective zero-epsilon local DP. Non-rare fields are privatized with RAPPOR, giving unbiased frequency estima",
