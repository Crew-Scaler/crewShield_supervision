  "summary": "5G Standalone deployments can exhibit uplink misbehavior from user equipment that remains fully compliant with standard control plane procedures. Manipulations such as transmit power inflation, gradual timing drift, and short off grant bursts leave the signaling state intact but distort the expected relationships among the telemetry streams produced by the gNB. This work examines whether these cross layer relationships can serve as a reliable basis for identifying such misbehavior without introd",
