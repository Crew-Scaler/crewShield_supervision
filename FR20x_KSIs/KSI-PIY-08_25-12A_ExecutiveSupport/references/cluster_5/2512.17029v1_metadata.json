  "summary": "Deep learning (DL)-based automated cybersickness detection methods, along with adaptive mitigation techniques, can enhance user comfort and interaction. However, recent studies show that these DL-based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks; small perturbations to sensor inputs can degrade model performance, trigger incorrect mitigation, and disrupt the user's immersive experience (UIX). Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated open-source testbeds that evaluate the robustness of these",
