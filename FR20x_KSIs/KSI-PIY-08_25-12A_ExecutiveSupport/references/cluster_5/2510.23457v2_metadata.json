  "summary": "The 5G protocol lacks a robust base station (BS) authentication mechanism during the initial bootstrapping phase, leaving it susceptible to threats such as fake BSs, spoofed broadcasts, and large-scale manipulation of System Information Blocks (SIBs). Despite real-world 5G deployments increasingly relying on multi-BS communication and user multi-connectivity, existing solutions incur high communication overheads, rely on centralized trust, and lack accountability and long-term breach resiliency.",
