  "summary": "This paper presents the development of a process automation architecture leveraging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for secure, transparent and efficient voting systems. The proposed architecture automates the voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote casting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart RFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using an RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontro",
