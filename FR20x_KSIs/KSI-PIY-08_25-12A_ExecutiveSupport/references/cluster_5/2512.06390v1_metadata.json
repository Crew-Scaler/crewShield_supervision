  "summary": "The modern web stack, which is dominated by browser-based applications and API-first backends, now operates under an adversarial equilibrium where automated, AI-assisted attacks evolve continuously. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and edge computing place programmable defenses closest to users and bots, making them natural enforcement points for machine-learning (ML) driven inspection, throttling, and isolation. This survey synthesizes the landscape of AI-enhanced defenses deployed at the edge:",
