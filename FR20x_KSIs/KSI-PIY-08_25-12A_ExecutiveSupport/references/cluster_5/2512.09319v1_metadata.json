  "summary": "Industrial cyber physical systems operate under heterogeneous sensing, stochastic dynamics, and shifting process conditions, producing data that are often incomplete, unlabeled, imbalanced, and domain shifted. High-fidelity datasets remain costly, confidential, and slow to obtain, while edge devices face strict limits on latency, bandwidth, and energy. These factors restrict the practicality of centralized deep learning, hinder the development of reliable digital twins, and increase the risk of ",
