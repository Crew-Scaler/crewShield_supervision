  "summary": "Provenance analysis based on system audit data has emerged as a fundamental approach for investigating Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks. Due to the high concealment and long-term persistence of APT attacks, they are only represented as a minimal part of the critical path in the provenance graph. While existing techniques employ behavioral pattern matching and data flow feature matching to uncover latent associations in attack sequences through provenance graph path reasoning, their inabi",
