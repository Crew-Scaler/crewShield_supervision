  "summary": "In this fast-evolving area of LLMs, our paper discusses the significant security risk presented by prompt injection attacks. It focuses on small open-sourced models, specifically the LLaMA family of models. We introduce novel defense mechanisms capable of generating automatic defenses and systematically evaluate said generated defenses against a comprehensive set of benchmarked attacks. Thus, we empirically demonstrated the improvement proposed by our approach in mitigating goal-hijacking vulner",
