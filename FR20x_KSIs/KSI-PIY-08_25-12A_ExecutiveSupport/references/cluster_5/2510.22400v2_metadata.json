  "summary": "Provenance analysis (PA) has recently emerged as an important solution for cyber attack investigation. PA leverages system monitoring to monitor system activities as a series of system audit events and organizes these events as a provenance graph to show the dependencies among system activities, which can reveal steps of cyber attacks. Despite their potential, existing PA techniques face two critical challenges: (1) they are inflexible and non-extensible, making it difficult to incorporate analy",
