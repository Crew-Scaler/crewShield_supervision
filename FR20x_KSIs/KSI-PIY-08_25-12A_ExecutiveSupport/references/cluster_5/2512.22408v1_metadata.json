  "summary": "This paper presents the development of a fully autonomous delivery robot integrating mechanical engineering, embedded systems, and artificial intelligence. The platform employs a heterogeneous computing architecture, with RPi 5 and ROS 2 handling AI-based perception and path planning, while ESP32 running FreeRTOS ensures real-time motor control. The mechanical design was optimized for payload capacity and mobility through precise motor selection and material engineering. Key technical challenges",
