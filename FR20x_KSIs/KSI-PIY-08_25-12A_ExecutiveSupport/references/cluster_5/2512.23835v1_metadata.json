  "summary": "Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations.
