# Extracted Metadata and Statistics

Extracted on: 01132026-1207

**Questions Moved to Other KSIs**: 5
  - Q011, Q012, Q015 → CMT-01 (evidence verification and logging)
  - Q014 → AIM-02 (model drift monitoring)
**Questions Removed**: 1
  - Customer-specific view of Q013 removed (consolidated to single executive oversight question)
**Final Question Count**: 23

**Refinement Rationale** (Based on GitHub Issue #65 Guidance):
Questions focused on evidence generation/verification (Q011, Q012, Q015) are better suited to continuous monitoring/logging KSIs. Model drift monitoring (Q014) belongs in AIM-02 specializing in AI performance. Shadow AI question (Q013) was refactored to executive governance perspective (detection and approval frameworks) rather than technical implementation details. All remaining questions address direct executive responsibilities: AI security strategy, risk appetite, governance visibility, resource allocation, incentive alignment, and accountability.

**Questions Staying in PIY-08**: Executive governance, strategy, resource allocation, incentive alignment, training, board reporting, regulatory engagement, AI ethics oversight, supply chain risk management.

**Questions Moved to Other KSIs** (Retained for reference):
- **Evidence Verification Questions** → CMT-01 (Log and Monitor Changes)
  - Real-time compliance dashboards and evidence verification
  - AI-generated control narratives and audit verification
  - AI-generated risk assessment verification and bias detection
- **Model Drift Monitoring** → AIM-02 (Model Drift and Runtime Monitoring)
  - Model drift monitoring and performance validation

**Shadow AI Question Refactored**: Original Q013 (technical implementation details) consolidated into Q004 (Executive Governance Visibility and Shadow AI Oversight) focusing on executive-level detection and approval oversight rather than technical controls.

**Next Steps**:
1. Finalize integration of moved questions into CMT-01 and AIM-02
2. Post summary comment on GitHub issue #65
3. Copy report and references from ksi_watch repository
4. Stage changes for review (no commit without explicit approval)
