**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets
**Filtering Criteria:** Questions directly assessing attack surface minimization for AI systems; removed generic privilege management, container security not specific to agents, and vendor selection procedures. Focus on AI agent-specific attack vectors: jailbreaks, prompt injection, privilege escalation by agents, agent compromise impacts, multi-agent cascades, compromised agent containment. Removed regulatory/compliance questions (original Q34-Q35) per review guidance; those questions are better suited to a separate governance/compliance KSI.

**Questions Removed in v1.1:**
- Original Q34 (regulatory frameworks mapping to NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO 42001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FedRAMP)
- Original Q35 (regulatory auditor findings and remediation tracking)
These questions are now part of a separate regulatory/compliance KSI and are no longer duplicated in the attack surface KSI.

**Current Focus:** 38 attack-surface-specific discovery questions organized into 9 thematic sections (from original 10), emphasizing practical attack surface minimization design rather than compliance documentation.

**Research Basis:** 216 papers synthesized into 10 thematic clusters emphasizing: AI agent isolation & containment (24 papers, 49.4MB), AI agent security & access control (21 papers, 37.5MB), agent behavior monitoring (25 papers, 65.3MB), attack path analysis (26 papers), supply chain security (45 papers). Key findings validated: 94.4% agent vulnerability without per-agent policies, 99.36% defense rate with CSAgent framework, 85-95% lateral movement detection achievable, privilege escalation paths identified and eliminable, multi-agent cascades modelable and preventable through network segmentation.
