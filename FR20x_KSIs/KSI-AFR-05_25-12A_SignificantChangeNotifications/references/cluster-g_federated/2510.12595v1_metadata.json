  "summary": "Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse s",
