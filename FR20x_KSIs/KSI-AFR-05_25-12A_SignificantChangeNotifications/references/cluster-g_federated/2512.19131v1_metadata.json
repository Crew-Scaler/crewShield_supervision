  "summary": "Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits ",
