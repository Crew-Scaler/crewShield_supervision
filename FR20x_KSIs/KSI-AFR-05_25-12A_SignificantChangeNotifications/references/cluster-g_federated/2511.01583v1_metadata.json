  "summary": "Detecting malware, especially ransomware, is essential to securing today's interconnected ecosystems, including cloud storage, enterprise file-sharing, and database services. Training high-performing artificial intelligence (AI) detectors requires diverse datasets, which are often distributed across multiple organizations, making centralization necessary. However, centralized learning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data ownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-or",
