  "summary": "Coordinated stealth attacks are a serious cybersecurity threat to distributed generation systems because they modify control and measurement signals while remaining close to normal behavior, making them difficult to detect using standard intrusion detection methods. This study investigates quantum machine learning approaches for detecting coordinated stealth attacks on a distributed generation unit in a microgrid. High-quality simulated measurements were used to create a balanced binary classifi",
