  "summary": "We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, an",
