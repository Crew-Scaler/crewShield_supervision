  "summary": "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used as a feature extraction technique for matrices with non-negative entries, such as image data, purchase histories, and other types of count data. In NMF, a non-negative matrix is decomposed into the product of two non-negative matrices, and the approximation accuracy is evaluated by a loss function. If the Kullback-Leibler divergence is chosen as the loss function, the estimation coincides with maximum likelihood under the assumption that the",
