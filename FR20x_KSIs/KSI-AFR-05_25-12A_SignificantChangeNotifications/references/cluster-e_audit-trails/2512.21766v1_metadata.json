  "summary": "Autonomous laboratories promise to accelerate discovery by coupling learning algorithms with robotic experimentation, yet adoption remains limited by fragmented software that separates high-level planning from low-level execution. Here we present UniLabOS, an AI-native operating system for autonomous laboratories that bridges digital decision-making and embodied experimentation through typed, stateful abstractions and transactional safeguards. UniLabOS unifies laboratory elements via an Action/R",
