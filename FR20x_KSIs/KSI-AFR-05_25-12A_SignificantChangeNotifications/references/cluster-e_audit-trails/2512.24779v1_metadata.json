  "summary": "Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size~$N$ is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. In the classical variant, an individual's selective advantage is proportional to the difference between the population average and the individual's mutation load, whereas in the ratchet with {\\em tournament selection} o",
