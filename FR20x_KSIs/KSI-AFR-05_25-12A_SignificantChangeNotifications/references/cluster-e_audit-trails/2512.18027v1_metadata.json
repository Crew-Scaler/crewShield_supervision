  "summary": "This paper details the methodology behind CoPE, a policy-steerable small language model capable of fast and accurate content labeling. We present a novel training curricula called Contradictory Example Training that enables the model to learn policy interpretation rather than mere policy memorization. We also present a novel method for generating content policies, called Binocular Labeling, which enables rapid construction of unambiguous training datasets. When evaluated across seven different h",
