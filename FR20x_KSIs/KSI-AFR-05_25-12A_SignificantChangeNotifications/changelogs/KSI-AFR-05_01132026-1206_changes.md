# Extracted Metadata and Statistics

Extracted on: 01132026-1206

**Question Organization** (After Fine-Tuning):
1. **CIO/CSP Internal** (46 questions): Change classification, authorization boundary management, notification processes, compliance, and supply chain visibility
2. **Customer/Agency** (29 questions): Change communication, impact assessment, approval processes, and oversight
3. **Auditor/3PAO** (8 questions): Control testing, documentation validation, and compliance verification

**AFR-05 Core Focus Areas**:
- Significant change notification decision logic and procedures
- Authorization boundary definition and change impact assessment
- Notification timeliness, format, and stakeholder communication
- Customer-facing notification adequacy and transparency
- Upstream supply chain change detection and cascading notification
- AI/agent-specific notification challenges (continuous changes, dynamic scope, non-deterministic systems)

**Questions Removed** (Weak AFR-05 Specificity):
- Generic volume/frequency questions better suited to operational metrics
- Confidence thresholds and SLA commitments (better covered in CMT-01/CMT-03)
- Overlapping advance notice questions consolidate under Q59-Q60

**Key Additions Preserved**:
- AI agent tool discovery and MCP server registration impacts
- Model lineage and dependency tracking for impact analysis
- Automated change classification thresholds with AI-specific metrics
- Continuous authorization validation for dynamic agent scope
- Upstream AI service provider change detection and notification requirements
