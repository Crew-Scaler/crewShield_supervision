  "summary": "We present CloudGaze, a distributed discovery system that maintains real-time inventory of all autonomous agents and automated workloads in cloud-native environments. The system uses flow analysis, resource tagging, and behavioral clustering to identify and classify agents. Deployed at Google, it manages 10M+ workloads with 99.2% classification accuracy.",
