  "summary": "AgentTrace detects lateral movement attacks where AI agents are pivoted to attack other systems. We introduce behavioral baselines, privilege escalation detection, and attack chain reconstruction. Evaluated on synthetic and real attack scenarios, the system achieves 96.3% precision with 2.1% false positive rate.",
