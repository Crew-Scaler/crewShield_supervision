  "summary": "This work addresses the challenge of securing short-lived service identities in containerized environments. We propose EphemeralGuard, which provides cryptographic binding of ephemeral identities to service lifecycle events. Our system maintains auditability while supporting 10K+ identity transitions per second with sub-100ms latency.",
