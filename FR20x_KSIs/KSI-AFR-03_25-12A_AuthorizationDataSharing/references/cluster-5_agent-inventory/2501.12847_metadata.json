  "summary": "This paper presents ShadowDetect, a comprehensive framework for discovering and auditing unauthorized AI agents operating in enterprise infrastructure. We identify key signatures of shadow agent behavior including unusual privilege escalation patterns, unusual resource consumption, and API call chains not registered in official inventories. Our approach achieves 94% detection accuracy across 50+ enterprise environments with minimal false positives.",
