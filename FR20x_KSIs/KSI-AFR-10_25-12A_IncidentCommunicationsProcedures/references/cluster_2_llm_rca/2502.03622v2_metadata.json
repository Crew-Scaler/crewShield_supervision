  "summary": "Phishing attacks remain a significant threat in the digital age, yet organizations lack effective methods to tackle phishing attacks without leaking sensitive information. Phish bowl initiatives are a vital part of cybersecurity efforts against these attacks. However, traditional phish bowls require manual anonymization and are often limited to internal use. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AdaPhish, an AI-powered phish bowl platform that automatically anonymizes and analyzes phishing emails using large language models (LLMs) and vector databases. AdaPhish achieves real-time detection and adaptation to new phishing tactics while enabling long-term tracking of phishing trends. Through automated reporting, adaptive analysis, and real-time alerts, AdaPhish presents a scalable, collaborative solution for phishing detection and cybersecurity education."
