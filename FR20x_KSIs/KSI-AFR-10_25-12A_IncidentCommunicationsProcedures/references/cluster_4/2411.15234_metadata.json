  "summary": "This paper presents a novel multi-agent system framework designed specifically for distributed incident response scenarios. We propose consistency protocols for agent synchronization across heterogeneous security monitoring systems. Our approach demonstrates how intelligent agents can coordinate to detect and respond to security incidents while maintaining data consistency across distributed logs and alerts."
