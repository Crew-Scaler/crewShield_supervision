  "summary": "Excessive and spurious alert generation by cloud security solutions is a root cause of analyst fatigue and operational inefficiencies. In this study, the long-standing issue of false positives from publicly accessible alerts in Amazon S3, as generated by a licensed cloud-native security solution, is examined. In a simulated production test environment, which consisted of over 1,000 Amazon S3 buckets with diverse access configurations, it was discovered that over 80\\% of the alerts generated by default rules were classified as false positives, thus demonstrating the severity of the detection issue. This severely impacted detection accuracy and generated a heavier workload for analysts due to redundant manual triage efforts. For addressing this problem, custom detection logic was created as an exercise of the native rule customization capabilities of the solution. A unified titled ``S3 Public Access Validation and Data Exposure'' was created in an effort to consolidate different forms of alerts into one, context-aware logic that systematically scans ACL configurations, bucket policies, indicators of public exposure, and the presence of sensitive data, and then marks only those S3 buckets that indeed denote security risk and are publicly exposed on the internet with no authentication. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in false positives, more precise alert fidelity, and significant time saving for security analysts, thus demonstrating an actionable and reproducible solution to enhance the accuracy of security alerting in compliance-focused cloud environments."
