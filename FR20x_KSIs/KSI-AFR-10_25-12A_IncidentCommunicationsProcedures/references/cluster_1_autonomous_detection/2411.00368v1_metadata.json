The platform works seamlessly in the background to analyze website behavior, network traffic, and user interactions, offering immediate feedback and alerts when potential threats are detected. By integrating this system into a user-friendly browser extension, the platform empowers individuals to navigate the web safely, reducing the risk of engaging with fraudulent websites. Its real-time functionality is crucial in e-commerce and everyday browsing, where quick, actionable insights can prevent financial losses, identity theft, and exposure to malicious sites. This paper explores how this solution offers a practical, fast-acting tool for enhancing online consumer protection, underscoring its potential to play a critical role in safeguarding users and maintaining trust in digital transactions. The platform's focus on speed and efficiency makes it an essential asset for preventing fraud in today's increasingly digital world."
