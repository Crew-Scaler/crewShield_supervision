  "summary": "As cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and frequency, robust endpoint protection is essential for organizational security. This paper presents \"Endpoint Security Agent: A Comprehensive Approach to Real-time System Monitoring and Threat Detection\" a modular, real-time security solution for Windows endpoints. The agent leverages native tools like WMI and ETW for lowlevel monitoring of system activities such as process execution, registry modifications, and network behaviour. A machine learning-based detection engine, trained on labelled datasets of benign and malicious activity, enables accurate threat identification with minimal false positives. Detection techniques are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for standardized threat classification. Designed for extensibility, the system includes a centralized interface for alerting and forensic analysis. Preliminary evaluation shows promising results in detecting diverse attack vectors with high accuracy and efficiency."
