  "summary": "Anomaly detection is a crucial task in cyber security. Technological advancement brings new cyber-physical threats like network intrusion, financial fraud, identity theft, and property invasion. In the rapidly changing world, with frequently emerging new types of anomalies, classical machine learning models are insufficient to prevent all the threats. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is emerging as a powerful computational tool that can detect anomalies more efficiently. In this work, we have introduced QML and its applications for anomaly detection in consumer electronics. We have shown a generic framework for applying QML algorithms in anomaly detection tasks. We have also briefly discussed popular supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning-based QML algorithms and included five case studies of recent works to show their applications in anomaly detection in the consumer electronics field."
