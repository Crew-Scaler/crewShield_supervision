  "summary": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines. However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection, spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000 balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and sensor fusion with other modalities."
