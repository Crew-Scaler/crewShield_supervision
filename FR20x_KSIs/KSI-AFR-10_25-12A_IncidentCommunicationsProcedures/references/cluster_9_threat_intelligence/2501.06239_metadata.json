  "summary": "Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is critical for mitigating threats to organizations, governments, and institutions, yet the necessary data are often dispersed across diverse formats. AI-driven solutions for CTI Information Extraction (IE) typically depend on high-quality, annotated data, which are not always available. This paper introduces 0-CTI, a scalable AI-based framework designed for efficient CTI Information Extraction. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, par"
