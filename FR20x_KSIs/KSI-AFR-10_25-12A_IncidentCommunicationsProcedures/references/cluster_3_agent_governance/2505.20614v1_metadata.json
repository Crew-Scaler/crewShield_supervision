  "summary": "This paper introduces EarthOL, a novel consensus protocol that attempts to replace computational waste in blockchain systems with verifiable human contributions within bounded domains. While recognizing the fundamental impossibility of universal value assessment, we propose a domain-restricted approach that acknowledges cultural diversity and subjective preferences while maintaining cryptographic security. Our enhanced Proof-of-Human-Contribution (PoHC) protocol uses a multi-layered verification system with domain-specific evaluation criteria, time-dependent validation mechanisms, and comprehensive security frameworks. We present theoretical analysis demonstrating meaningful progress toward incentive-compatible human contribution verification in high-consensus domains, achieving Byzantine fault tolerance in controlled scenarios while addressing significant scalability and cultural bias challenges. Through game-theoretic analysis, probabilistic modeling, and enhanced security protocols, we identify specific conditions under which the protocol remains stable and examine failure modes with comprehensive mitigation strategies. This work contributes to understanding the boundaries of decentralized value assessment and provides a framework for future research in human-centered consensus mechanisms for specific application domains, with particular emphasis on validator and security specialist incentive systems."
