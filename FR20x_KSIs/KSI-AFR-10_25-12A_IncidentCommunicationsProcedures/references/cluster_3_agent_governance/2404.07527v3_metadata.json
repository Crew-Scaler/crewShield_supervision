  "summary": "Cyber-physical systems are at the intersection of digital technology and engineering domains, rendering them high-value targets of sophisticated and well-funded cybersecurity threat actors. Prominent cybersecurity attacks on CPS have brought attention to the vulnerability of these systems and the inherent weaknesses of critical infrastructure reliant on them. Security modelling for CPS is an important mechanism to systematically identify and assess vulnerabilities, threats, and risks throughout system life cycles, and to ultimately ensure system resilience, safety, and reliability. This survey delves into state-of-the-art research on CPS security modelling, encompassing both threat and attack modelling. While these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they are different concepts. This paper elaborates on the differences between threat and attack modelling, examining their implications for CPS security. We conducted a systematic search that yielded 449 papers, from which 32 were selected and categorised into three clusters: those focused on threat modelling methods, attack modelling methods, and literature reviews. Specifically, we sought to examine what security modelling methods exist today, and how they address real-world cybersecurity threats and CPS-specific attacker capabilities throughout the life cycle of CPS, which typically span longer durations compared to traditional IT systems. This paper also highlights several limitations in existing research, wherein security models adopt simplistic approaches that do not adequately consider the dynamic, multi-layer, multi-path, and multi-agent characteristics of real-world cyber-physical attacks."
