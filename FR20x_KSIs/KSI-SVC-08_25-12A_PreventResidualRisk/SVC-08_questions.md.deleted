## CIO Questions: Residual Risk Management Governance and Decision-Making

### SVC-08-Q001: Agent Change Governance and Accountability Framework

How does your organization currently track and justify autonomous agent-initiated infrastructure changes within compliance frameworks?

**Sub-questions**:
- What decision-level audit trails do your agents maintain (detection triggers, evaluation criteria, rejected alternatives, confidence thresholds, decision rationale)?
- How do you attribute multi-system infrastructure modifications executed by agents when failures occur across distributed systems?
- What change rollback procedures exist for agent-initiated changes that create unintended residual elements, and how do you coordinate rollback with downstream systems already depending on those changes?

**Compliance Implication**: FedRAMP requires persistent review and justification of post-change residual elements; agent autonomy that lacks sufficient decision-level logging creates compliance gaps preventing forensic reconstruction.

**AI/Agent Context**: Autonomous agents collapse traditional change management review gates, creating residual elements outside established compliance frameworks. Attribution becomes critical when multi-agent systems create distributed state changes.

---

### SVC-08-Q002: Multi-Tenant Isolation Validation and Cross-Contamination Prevention

For multi-tenant infrastructure serving federal customers at different impact levels, how does your organization validate that residual elements from higher-impact customer workloads do not contaminate lower-impact customer systems?

**Sub-questions**:
- GPU memory wiping procedures between tenant job transitions—what validation confirms overwrites are cryptographically secure?
- Container image layer sharing detection—how frequently are shared nodes tested for residual files from previous tenants?
- Service mesh configuration cleanup procedures—what verification confirms residual configurations do not persist between tenant terminations?

**Compliance Implication**: Cross-tenant residual contamination represents unmitigated risk violating isolation assumptions federal customers depend on for FedRAMP authorization.

**AI/Agent Context**: GPU memory retains model weights and inference batch data between tenant workloads. Container caches and shared service mesh configurations create additional cross-tenant residual exposure vectors.

---

### SVC-08-Q003: Model Lifecycle and Ghost Data Governance

How does your organization manage residual data embedded in machine learning models used for federal customer services?

**Sub-questions**:
- What policies define how long raw training data persists after model training completes, and who enforces these policies?
- What membership inference testing frequency (quarterly, post-update, post-fine-tuning) verifies that customer training data is not embedded as ghost data in production models?
- When unlearning procedures are applied to remove ghost data, what verification methodology confirms unlearning effectiveness, and how do you communicate unlearning limitations to federal customers?

**Compliance Implication**: Ghost data represents a fundamentally new residual category that FedRAMP assessors frequently do not address; explicit governance demonstrates proactive risk management.

**AI/Agent Context**: Model parameters memorize training data extractable through membership inference attacks. Unlearning techniques cannot definitively prove information absence, only that detection methods fail.

---

### SVC-08-Q004: Non-Human Identity Credential Lifecycle and Service Discontinuation Coordination

Given AI workloads' dramatic increase in service account, API key, and temporary token sprawl, how does your organization manage credential lifecycle to prevent residual access from discontinued services?

**Sub-questions**:
- What quarterly NHI inventory audit process verifies each credential is still necessary, has expiration dates set (no permanent credentials), and has access scope matching current workload requirements?
- When services discontinue, what procedures ensure credentials are removed from active systems and deleted from backups within acceptable windows?
- What incident response scope determination methodology uses NHI inventory to quantify potentially compromised credentials' blast radius?

**Compliance Implication**: Credential residue from discontinued services creates persistent attack surface; systematic NHI lifecycle management is foundational for incident response efficiency.

**AI/Agent Context**: A 30-second agent task receives credentials valid for 1 hour, leaving 59.5 minutes of unnecessary exposure. Hardcoded credentials in Jupyter notebooks, container images, and deployment manifests prevent cleanup on artifact updates.

---

### SVC-08-Q005: Ephemeral Infrastructure Residual Artifact Cleanup Coordination

AI workloads extensively use ephemeral compute (containers, functions, jobs) that create residual artifacts across multiple persistence systems. How does your organization coordinate cleanup across this heterogeneous environment?

**Sub-questions**:
- What declarative artifact lifecycle specifications automatically trigger cleanup across storage, databases, caches, credentials, and logging systems when a task completes?
- For training jobs creating multi-terabyte intermediate datasets "for the next run," what policies explicitly manage when this data is retained versus deleted?
- What verification procedures confirm that cleanup succeeded across all systems (e.g., deleting a model checkpoint removes it from all serving infrastructure caches, not just primary storage)?

**Compliance Implication**: Residual artifacts in secondary systems (forgotten model checkpoints, cached training datasets) create unquantified attack surface that traditional residual risk assessments miss.

**AI/Agent Context**: Ephemeral containers create assumption of no persistent residue, but persistent volumes, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and cached datasets accumulate without explicit ownership cleanup rules.

---

### SVC-08-Q006: RAG Contamination and Vector Database Residual Cleanup

For Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems supporting AI agents or models, how does your organization manage residual information in vector databases when sensitive documents must be removed?

**Sub-questions**:
- When a document containing sensitive information (credentials, PII, classified data) is deleted, what procedures remove its semantic embeddings from vector databases?
- What verification confirms that semantically similar queries do not retrieve residual vector representations near deleted content?
- What re-embedding procedures balance completeness (removing all traces) against availability (service disruption during re-indexing)?

**Compliance Implication**: Vector database embeddings retain semantic representation of sensitive information even after source documents are deleted, creating information disclosure risks.

**AI/Agent Context**: RAG systems embed documents into high-dimensional vector spaces where deletion requires re-embedding entire knowledge bases, an operation affecting service availability. Incomplete deletion enables residual information retrieval through semantic similarity.

---

### SVC-08-Q007: Configuration Drift Detection from Autonomous Agent Modifications

How does your organization distinguish beneficial configuration drift from autonomous agents versus unauthorized changes that create residual risk?

**Sub-questions**:
- What agent decision frameworks document drift authorization criteria?
- How do drift detection systems identify legitimate agent-initiated changes without creating false positive operational friction?
- What audit trails track configuration changes including agent remediation rationale?

**Compliance Implication**: FedRAMP requires infrastructure to match documented baselines; agent-driven drift that compliance treats as unauthorized creates validation challenges.

**AI/Agent Context**: Self-healing and optimization agents autonomously modify infrastructure without explicit IaC updates. Traditional drift detection cannot distinguish beneficial agent actions from malicious configuration changes.

---

### SVC-08-Q008: Prompt Injection Residual State and Recovery Procedures

When prompt injection attacks are detected affecting AI agents or RAG systems, what procedures identify and remediate residual state persisting beyond the attack session?

**Sub-questions**:
- What forensic investigation procedures identify all data stored in agent memory, vector databases, and tool execution logs during the attack window?
- How do you verify that injected instructions are completely removed from RAG knowledge bases without requiring full re-embedding?
- What behavioral monitoring detects residual effects from injection-driven tool executions that modified connected systems?

**Compliance Implication**: Injection persistence represents residual threat affecting future agent operations; post-compromise cleanup requires forensic analysis of all tool executions.

**AI/Agent Context**: Malicious instructions stored in agent memory or RAG knowledge bases persist across sessions, enabling cross-session attack effects. Tool chain exploitation creates residual elements in connected systems.

---

## Customer Questions: CSP Capability Evaluation and Service Commitments

### SVC-08-Q009: Model Ghost Data Transparency and Removal Guarantees

If your CSP hosts machine learning models trained or fine-tuned on customer data, what transparency can you provide about ghost data?

**Sub-questions**:
- What membership inference testing results document that customer training data is not embedded in production models?
- If ghost data is detected, what unlearning procedures are applied and what verification confirms their effectiveness?
- Can you provide explicit statements about unlearning limitations—acknowledging that ghost data absence cannot be definitively proven?
- If models are shared across multiple customers (multi-tenant fine-tuning), what cryptographic isolation guarantees prevent one customer's training data from contaminating another customer's model?

**Customer Implication**: Current unlearning techniques cannot definitively prove information absence; customers need honest assessment of ghost data risks rather than over-confident removal guarantees.

**AI/Agent Context**: Models memorize training data in parameters extractable through specialized attacks. Multi-tenant model hosting risks federal data exposure between customers through fine-tuning contamination.

---

### SVC-08-Q010: Agent-Driven Infrastructure Changes and Audit Trail Availability

If your CSP uses autonomous agents for infrastructure management (auto-scaling, self-healing, optimization), what audit trail transparency exists for changes affecting customer services?

**Sub-questions**:
- Can you provide decision-level logs showing why agents made specific changes (detection triggers, evaluation criteria, confidence thresholds)?
- How is multi-agent coordination tracked when one agent's decisions depend on other agents' outputs?
- What incident investigation procedures reconstruct agent-driven changes that created unintended residual elements?

**Customer Implication**: Customers need to understand who (or which agent) made changes affecting their services and the reasoning behind those decisions for compliance and operational understanding.

**AI/Agent Context**: Agent decision-making frequently lacks sufficient audit trails for forensic reconstruction of why changes occurred, complicating compliance validation and incident investigation.

---

### SVC-08-Q011: Credential Exposure Risk and NHI Incident Response Scope

If credentials are discovered compromised (discovered in code repositories, backup leaks, or logs), how does your CSP determine which customer systems could have been affected?

**Sub-questions**:
- Do you maintain a complete NHI inventory mapping all service accounts, API keys, and system identities to specific services?
- How quickly can you calculate compromise scope (which systems could the compromised credentials access, what data could they have accessed)?
- What incident notification procedures do you follow to inform customers of credential compromise, including scope analysis and remediation evidence?

**Customer Implication**: Incident response scope determination depends on NHI inventory completeness; vague "we do not know if your data was accessed" notifications significantly damage customer confidence.

**AI/Agent Context**: AI deployments dramatically increase non-human identity credential sprawl across service accounts, API keys, and temporary tokens. Multiple credential copies (source, backup, documentation) complicate cleanup.

---

### SVC-08-Q012: Ephemeral Workload Residual Cleanup Verification

For ephemeral workloads (batch jobs, training jobs, inference tasks), what verification procedures confirm that residual elements are completely cleaned up?

**Sub-questions**:
- When a customer's training job completes, what procedures delete model checkpoints, intermediate datasets, and training artifacts across all storage systems?
- Can you provide evidence that temporary credentials issued for the job have expired or been revoked?
- What residual state testing (attempting to trigger information from completed tasks) confirms cleanup succeeded?

**Customer Implication**: Ephemeral workloads create assumption that "no persistent residue exists" because containers are deleted; customers need verification that this assumption holds across all artifact repositories.

**AI/Agent Context**: Training jobs create multi-terabyte datasets and hundreds of checkpoint snapshots. Kubernetes persistent volumes, ConfigMaps, and Secrets remain after pod deletion unless explicit ownership cleanup rules apply.

---

### SVC-08-Q013: Multi-Tenant Isolation Validation During Service Execution

If your infrastructure is multi-tenant (sharing compute, storage, or model serving resources with other customers), what validation can you provide that customer data is not accessible through residual contamination?

**Sub-questions**:
- What GPU memory wiping procedures (with cryptographically secure overwriting) execute between customer job transitions?
- What testing detects container image layer sharing between customer workloads?
- What service mesh configuration cleanup prevents residual routing rules from one customer's workload exposing another customer's endpoints?

**Customer Implication**: Federal customers require assurance that multi-tenancy does not create residual cross-tenant visibility of their data through infrastructure residue.

**AI/Agent Context**: GPU memory between tenant workloads retains model weights and inference batch data accessible to subsequent jobs. Container image layers cached on shared nodes are accessible across tenant executions.

---

### SVC-08-Q014: Training Artifact Lifecycle Management and Retention Clarity

For machine learning training pipelines, what explicit lifecycle policies govern retention and cleanup of model artifacts?

**Sub-questions**:
- What retention windows apply to model checkpoints saved every N training steps (potentially hundreds of snapshots for large models)?
- How are optimizer state files, gradient checkpoints, and hyperparameter search results managed for cleanup?
- What procedures coordinate federated learning artifact cleanup across distributed participant systems?

**Customer Implication**: Training artifacts accumulate without explicit lifecycle policies, creating storage costs and potential data exposure from forgotten artifacts.

**AI/Agent Context**: ML lifecycle creates artifact proliferation challenging traditional cleanup. Expensive-to-regenerate artifacts encourage long retention. Distributed training creates multiple copies requiring coordinated cleanup.

---

### SVC-08-Q015: Cross-Session Agent Memory Isolation Guarantees

For conversational agents or persistent AI assistants serving multiple users, what isolation guarantees prevent context leakage between sessions?

**Sub-questions**:
- How is session-level memory isolation implemented (separate agent instances per session versus software filtering within shared instances)?
- What memory sanitization procedures execute between user sessions to prevent information from one user influencing another user's interactions?
- What verification testing attempts to trigger residual information from previous sessions to confirm isolation effectiveness?

**Customer Implication**: Context leakage between sessions enables cross-contamination of sensitive information, violating confidentiality assumptions for multi-user agent services.

**AI/Agent Context**: Shared agent instances serving multiple users create context bleed where information from one user's session influences subsequent users through agent memory mechanisms lacking user-level isolation.

---

## Auditor Questions: Control Implementation and Verification Procedures

### SVC-08-Q016: Automated Residual Element Detection System Effectiveness

What automated systems does your organization maintain for detecting residual elements across your infrastructure?

**Sub-questions**:
- For orphaned resources: what cloud provider APIs (AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph, GCP Resource Manager) are queried, how frequently, and what detection thresholds trigger cleanup?
- For explicit data remnants: what DLP tools and sensitive pattern scanning (PII, financial data, credentials) operate continuously, and what false positive rates are acceptable before manual review?
- For AI-specific residual categories (ghost data, agent memory, training artifacts): what specialized detection techniques are deployed, and what are their detection coverage gaps?

**Audit Implication**: Effective control implementation requires demonstrating that automated detection systems function continuously and that detected residual elements trigger documented remediation.

**AI/Agent Context**: AI-specific residual categories require specialized detection beyond traditional infrastructure scanning: membership inference testing for ghost data, conversation history analysis for agent memory, storage pattern matching for training artifacts.

---

### SVC-08-Q017: Membership Inference Testing for ML Models and Ghost Data Verification

For machine learning models used in production (especially those trained or fine-tuned on customer data), what testing verifies ghost data absence?

**Sub-questions**:
- What membership inference testing methodology is applied, how frequently, and what positive/negative decision thresholds indicate ghost data risk?
- When membership inference succeeds (indicating ghost data), what unlearning procedures are applied and what re-testing confirms effectiveness?
- What documentation explicitly acknowledges unlearning limitations and communicates residual uncertainty to customers?
- For multi-tenant models, what isolation validation procedures confirm that one customer's fine-tuning cannot extract another customer's training data?

**Audit Implication**: Ghost data represents non-traditional residual risk that FedRAMP assessors are learning to evaluate; explicit testing and documentation demonstrate proactive control implementation.

**AI/Agent Context**: Ghost data persists in model parameters despite training data deletion. Unlearning verification cannot definitively prove information absence, only that specific attack vectors fail.

---

### SVC-08-Q018: Agent Change Attribution and Decision-Level Audit Trail Completeness

For autonomous agent-driven infrastructure changes, what audit trail evidence documents the control effectiveness required by FedRAMP?

**Sub-questions**:
- What agent decision logging captures detection triggers, evaluation criteria, alternative options considered, confidence thresholds, and final decision rationale?
- How is multi-agent coordination documented when agent decisions depend on other agents' outputs?
- What forensic investigation tools enable reconstruction of agent-driven changes to validate that residual elements were unintended versus expected side effects?
- How frequently are agent decision logs audited to ensure sufficient completeness for compliance reporting?

**Audit Implication**: Traditional change management documentation standards do not address agent autonomy; explicit agent audit trail requirements demonstrate FedRAMP-compliant control adaptation.

**AI/Agent Context**: Autonomous agents collapse change execution into milliseconds without human approval at each step. Multi-system transaction residue from partial failures lacks clear attribution.

---

### SVC-08-Q019: Credential Lifecycle Validation and NHI Inventory Audit

What procedures validate that credential lifecycle management prevents residual credentials from discontinued services?

**Sub-questions**:
- What quarterly NHI inventory audit procedures verify each credential's necessity, expiration dates (confirming no permanent credentials), and access scope appropriateness?
- How are audit findings (unnecessary credentials, missing expirations, overly-broad permissions) remediated and re-validated?
- What incident response scope analysis procedures use NHI inventory to quantify potentially compromised credentials' blast radius?
- For hardcoded credentials discovered in artifacts (notebooks, images, manifests), what incident procedures trigger immediate revocation, artifact rebuild, and exposure investigation?

**Audit Implication**: Complete NHI inventory and credential lifecycle validation are foundational for incident response efficiency and FedRAMP compliance; audit frequency and remediation documentation demonstrates control maturity.

**AI/Agent Context**: Service accounts, API keys, temporary tokens, and service mesh identities accumulate across AI workloads. Credential lifecycle mismatches create persistent exposure when short-lived tasks retain long-lived credentials.

---

### SVC-08-Q020: GPU Memory Cryptographic Wiping Validation Procedures

For multi-tenant GPU workload transitions, what procedures validate that memory wiping is cryptographically secure?

**Sub-questions**:
- What overwrite patterns (aligned with NIST SP 800-88 guidelines) are used for GPU memory sanitization between tenant jobs?
- What verification reads confirm that overwritten memory is no longer recoverable through cryptanalysis?
- For high-impact federal workloads, what confidential computing enclaves (AMD SEV, Intel SGX) provide hardware-enforced isolation instead of software-based cleanup?

**Audit Implication**: GPU memory contamination violates multi-tenant isolation assumptions; cryptographic validation demonstrates control effectiveness.

**AI/Agent Context**: GPU memory retains model weights and inference batch data accessible to subsequent tenant jobs. Software-based cleanup without cryptographic verification is insufficient for federal data protection.

---

### SVC-08-Q021: Container Image Layer Residual Contamination Testing

How frequently are shared container nodes tested for residual files from previous tenants' container executions?

**Sub-questions**:
- What testing procedures scan container image caches for residual files accessible across tenant boundaries?
- When residual contamination is discovered, what incident procedures trigger node maintenance (storage wiping, re-provisioning)?
- What documentation in compliance reports demonstrates multi-tenant infrastructure residual risks are actively monitored?

**Audit Implication**: Container image layer sharing creates cross-tenant visibility risks; monthly testing frequency demonstrates continuous monitoring.

**AI/Agent Context**: Container images cached on shared nodes are accessible across tenant executions. Multi-tenant Kubernetes environments accumulate residual ConfigMaps, Secrets, and persistent volume data without ownership cleanup.

---

### SVC-08-Q022: Service Mesh Residual Configuration Detection and Cleanup

When tenant workloads terminate, what procedures detect and remove residual service mesh configurations?

**Sub-questions**:
- What automated cleanup removes ingress rules, load balancer configurations, mTLS certificates, circuit breaker policies, and observability rules specific to terminated tenants?
- What verification testing attempts to establish connections to deleted tenant endpoints to confirm residual configuration absence?
- How are cleanup procedures tested end-to-end before tenant offboarding in production?

**Audit Implication**: Service mesh configurations carry forward tenant-specific policies and routing rules that violate isolation when workloads terminate.

**AI/Agent Context**: Agent workloads create dynamic service mesh configurations. Autonomous scaling and termination leave residual routing rules and policy configurations accessible to unintended workloads.

---

### SVC-08-Q023: IaC State File Exposure and Architectural Reconnaissance Risk

What procedures protect Infrastructure-as-Code state files from exposure and residual reconnaissance risks?

**Sub-questions**:
- What access controls protect Terraform state files and CloudFormation templates containing sensitive architecture information (database endpoints, model serving URLs, integration points)?
- What procedures manage residual state files from decommissioned AI systems retained for potential rollback?
- How long are historical state files retained, and what justification supports retention windows?

**Audit Implication**: State file exposure reveals entire AI system architecture; residual state files from discontinued services create persistent reconnaissance risks.

**AI/Agent Context**: AI infrastructure state files reveal model serving endpoints, training job configurations, and data pipeline architectures. Agent-driven infrastructure creates frequent state updates with residual exposure windows.

---

### SVC-08-Q024: Agent Rollback and Roll-Forward Residual Correction Procedures

When agent-initiated changes create unintended residual elements, what procedures correct the residual state?

**Sub-questions**:
- What rollback coordination procedures notify downstream systems already depending on agent changes?
- What roll-forward correction mechanisms re-engage agent loops to execute additional corrective actions?
- What validation confirms that rollback/roll-forward succeeded without creating new residual elements?

**Audit Implication**: Agent decision-making depends on temporal context; rollback impossibility requires documented roll-forward procedures.

**AI/Agent Context**: Agent decisions based on market conditions, threat intelligence, or system performance cannot be rolled back when context changes. Multi-system agent actions lack transactional guarantees creating partial failure residue.

---

### SVC-08-Q025: Unlearning Verification Limitations and Customer Communication

What documentation explicitly communicates machine learning unlearning limitations to customers and auditors?

**Sub-questions**:
- What unlearning verification procedures are applied (membership inference testing, model inversion attack attempts)?
- What explicit statements acknowledge that ghost data absence cannot be definitively proven, only that detection techniques fail?
- How are unlearning limitations documented in customer-facing materials and compliance artifacts?

**Audit Implication**: Honest assessment of unlearning limitations demonstrates transparency required for federal customer confidence.

**AI/Agent Context**: Current research cannot definitively prove training data removal from models. Verification techniques only confirm specific detection methods fail, not absolute information absence.

---

### SVC-08-Q026: Federated Learning Distributed Artifact Cleanup Coordination

For federated learning deployments, what procedures coordinate artifact cleanup across distributed participant systems?

**Sub-questions**:
- What cleanup coordination protocols ensure all participants delete local dataset replicas when model training completes?
- What verification confirms that distributed model checkpoints and gradient updates are removed from participant systems?
- What incident procedures address incomplete cleanup when participants are offline or unresponsive during cleanup coordination?

**Audit Implication**: Distributed training creates residual data copies at each participant; cleanup coordination failures create unquantified data exposure.

**AI/Agent Context**: Federated learning maintains dataset replicas at each participant for multiple training rounds. Centralized model completion does not guarantee distributed artifact cleanup.

---

### SVC-08-Q027: Configuration Drift Authorization and Compliance Documentation

How does your organization document that agent-initiated configuration drift is authorized rather than representing unauthorized changes?

**Sub-questions**:
- What agent decision frameworks capture drift authorization criteria?
- How are drift detection systems configured to distinguish agent-initiated changes from malicious modifications?
- What audit trails enable compliance reporting of authorized drift post-change?

**Audit Implication**: FedRAMP requires infrastructure matching documented baselines; agent-driven drift requires explicit authorization documentation.

**AI/Agent Context**: Self-healing agents, optimization agents, and remediation agents autonomously modify infrastructure creating legitimate drift. Compliance frameworks treating all drift as unauthorized create validation challenges.

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes

**Residual Element Classification**: Questions address traditional categories (orphaned resources, explicit data remnants, configuration carryover) and AI-specific categories (ghost data, agent memory, training artifacts, ephemeral credential persistence, multi-tenant contamination).

**Continuous Monitoring Integration**: Questions support monthly FedRAMP reporting requirements through automated detection systems, remediation validation, and audit trail completeness.

**Cost-Benefit Calibration**: Questions address operational tradeoffs between aggressive residual cleanup (performance overhead, availability impact) and compliance requirements.

**Audit Readiness**: Questions provide evidence frameworks for demonstrating control effectiveness to independent auditors through testing results, remediation documentation, and forensic investigation capabilities.
