# Extracted Metadata and Statistics

Extracted on: 01132026-1208

**Questions Moved to Other KSIs**: 5
**Cross-KSI Integration from SVC-04**: 2 (configuration drift residue + agent remediation residue)
**Final Question Count**: 20
**Refined Focus**: Discrete, residual-risk-specific questions with perspective-neutral language, including configuration automation cross-KSI integration

**Questions Consolidated** (merged duplicate stakeholder perspectives):
- Agent change attribution/decision-level audit: Q001 (CIO) + Q010 (Customer) + Q018/Q027 (Auditor) → Single consolidated question (Q01)
- Ghost data/unlearning: Q003 (CIO) + Q017 (Auditor) → Single consolidated question (Q03); Q009 (Customer) + Q025 (Auditor comms) → Moved to governance/customer transparency KSI
- Credential lifecycle/NHI inventory: Q004 (CIO) + Q019 (Auditor) → Single consolidated question (Q04); Q011 (Customer notifications) → Moved to incident response KSI
- Configuration drift: Q007 (CIO) + Q027 (Auditor) → Single consolidated question (Q07)

**Questions Moved to Other KSIs**:
- SVC-08-Q016 (Automated Residual Element Detection) → CMT-01 (Log and Monitor Changes) - continuous monitoring is CMT-01 focus
- SVC-08-Q020 (GPU Memory Cryptographic Wiping) → Folded into Q02 (Multi-Tenant Isolation)
- SVC-08-Q021 (Container Image Layer Testing) → Folded into Q02 (Multi-Tenant Isolation)
- SVC-08-Q022 (Service Mesh Configuration Cleanup) → Folded into Q02 (Multi-Tenant Isolation)
- SVC-08-Q023 (IaC State File Exposure) → Moved to CNA-01 (Restrict Network Traffic) or configuration management KSI

**Perspective-Neutral Refinement**: All questions reframed to remove CIO/Customer/Auditor language, focusing on technical control mechanisms and verification evidence required by FedRAMP SC-4/SC-7.

## Core Residual Risk Questions

**Questions Moved to Other KSIs**:
- IaC State File Exposure and Architectural Reconnaissance Risk (formerly SVC-08-Q023) → Recommend integration into CNA-01 (Restrict Network Traffic) or future configuration management KSI focused on architectural exposure risks

**Questions Integrated from KSI-SVC-04 (per GitHub Issue #47)**:
- **SVC-08-Q19** (Safe Change Workflows and Configuration Drift Residue Prevention): Duplicated from SVC-04-Q05 concept. Addresses residual compliance risk from cumulative configuration changes. SVC-04 version focuses on agent-level prevention mechanisms; SVC-08 version focuses on residual risk assessment for approved changes with unintended cumulative impact.
- **SVC-08-Q20** (Residual Configuration Elements from Agent-Driven Remediation): Derived from SVC-04-Q18, Q34, Q35 concepts. Addresses residual configuration artifacts left after agent remediation. Complements SVC-04's focus on agent autonomy decisions with SVC-08's focus on preventing residual elements persisting after remediation.

**Document Status**: Refined per GitHub issue #67 guidance - added deletion-related residual risk questions from KSI-SVC-10, consolidated perspective-neutral language applied.

**Version:** 4.1 (Integrated Configuration Automation Cross-KSI Questions)
**Generated:** 2026-01-12
**Refined:** 2026-01-13 (per GitHub Issue #47 - SVC-04 integration; per GitHub Issue #67 - SVC-10 refinement)
**Filtering Criteria:** Discrete, residual-risk-specific questions focused on FedRAMP SC-4/SC-7 compliance. Integrated deletion-related residual risk questions addressing continuous learning safeguards, data re-ingestion prevention, and agent re-discovery pathways. Integrated configuration automation residual questions addressing cumulative compliance drift and agent-driven remediation residue. Applied perspective-neutral technical framing.
**Question Count:** 20 core discovery questions (15 original + 3 deletion-specific from SVC-10 + 2 configuration automation cross-KSI from SVC-04)
