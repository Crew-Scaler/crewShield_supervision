  "summary": "The deployment of robust malware detection systems in big data environments requires careful consideration of both security effectiveness and computational efficiency. While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Ov",
