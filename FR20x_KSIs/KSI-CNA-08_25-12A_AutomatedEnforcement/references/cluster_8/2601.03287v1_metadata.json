  "summary": "Cybersecurity post-incident reviews are essential for identifying control failures and improving organisational resilience, yet they remain labour-intensive, time-consuming, and heavily reliant on expert judgment. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the",
