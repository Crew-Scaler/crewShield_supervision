  "summary": "The rapid proliferation of IoT applications has intensified the demand for efficient and secure service placement in Fog computing. However, heterogeneous resources, dynamic workloads, and diverse security requirements make optimal service placement highly challenging. Most solutions focus primarily on performance metrics while overlooking the security implications of deployment decisions. This paper proposes a Security and Performance-Aware Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (SPA-DDRL) fra",
