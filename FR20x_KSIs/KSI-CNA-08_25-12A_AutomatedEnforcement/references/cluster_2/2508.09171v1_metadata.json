  "title": "webMCP: Efficient AI-Native Client-Side Interaction for Agent-Ready Web Design",
  "published": "2025-08-06T23:02:36Z",
  "summary": "Current AI agents create significant barriers for users by requiring extensive processing to understand web pages, making AI-assisted web interaction slow and expensive. This paper introduces webMCP (Web Machine Context & Procedure), a client-side standard that embeds structured interaction metadata directly into web pages, enabling more efficient human-AI collaboration on existing websites. webMCP transforms how AI agents understand web interfaces by providing explicit mappings between page ele",
