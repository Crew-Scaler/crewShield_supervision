  "summary": "Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) integrate physical elements, such as transportation infrastructure and vehicles, with cyber elements via advanced communication technologies, allowing them to interact seamlessly. This integration enhances the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of transportation systems. TCPS rely heavily on cryptographic security to protect sensitive information transmitted between vehicles, transportation infrastructure, and other entities within the transportat",
