  "published": "2025-09-05T07:41:54Z",
  "summary": "We propose the Ratio1 AI meta-operating system (meta-OS), a decentralized MLOps protocol that unifies AI model development, deployment, and inference across heterogeneous edge devices. Its key innovation is an integrated blockchain-based framework that transforms idle computing resources (laptops, smartphones, cloud VMs) into a trustless global supercomputer. The architecture includes novel components: a decentralized authentication layer (dAuth), an in-memory state database (CSTORE), a distribu",
