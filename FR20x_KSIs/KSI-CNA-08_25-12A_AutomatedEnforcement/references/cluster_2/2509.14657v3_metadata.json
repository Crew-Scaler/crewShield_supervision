  "title": "Threat Modeling for Enhancing Security of IoT Audio Classification Devices under a Secure Protocols Framework",
  "published": "2025-09-18T06:25:50Z",
  "summary": "The rapid proliferation of IoT nodes equipped with microphones and capable of performing on-device audio classification exposes highly sensitive data while operating under tight resource constraints. To protect against this, we present a defence-in-depth architecture comprising a security protocol that treats the edge device, cellular network and cloud backend as three separate trust domains, linked by TPM-based remote attestation and mutually authenticated TLS 1.3. A STRIDE-driven threat model ",
