  "summary": "This paper introduces a Blockchain-Integrated Explainable AI Framework (BXHF) for healthcare systems to tackle two essential challenges confronting health information networks: safe data exchange and comprehensible AI-driven clinical decision-making. Our architecture incorporates blockchain, ensuring patient records are immutable, auditable, and tamper-proof, alongside Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies that yield transparent and clinically relevant model predictions. By incorporating security a",
