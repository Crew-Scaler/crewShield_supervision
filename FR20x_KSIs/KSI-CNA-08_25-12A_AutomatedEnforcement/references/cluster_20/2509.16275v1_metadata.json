  "title": "SecureFixAgent: A Hybrid LLM Agent for Automated Python Static Vulnerability Repair",
  "published": "2025-09-18T15:45:43Z",
  "summary": "Modern software development pipelines face growing challenges in securing large codebases with extensive dependencies. Static analysis tools like Bandit are effective at vulnerability detection but suffer from high false positives and lack repair capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), in contrast, can suggest fixes but often hallucinate changes and lack self-validation. We present SecureFixAgent, a hybrid repair framework integrating Bandit with lightweight local LLMs (<8B parameters) in an",
