  "title": "Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis",
  "published": "2025-09-13T03:51:11Z",
  "summary": "Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fiel",
