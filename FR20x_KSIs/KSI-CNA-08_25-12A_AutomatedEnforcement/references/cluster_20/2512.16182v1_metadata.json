  "title": "DualGuard: Dual-stream Large Language Model Watermarking Defense against Paraphrase and Spoofing Attack",
  "published": "2025-12-18T05:08:19Z",
  "summary": "With the rapid development of cloud-based services, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly accessible through various web platforms. However, this accessibility has also led to growing risks of model abuse. LLM watermarking has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate such misuse and protect intellectual property. Existing watermarking algorithms, however, primarily focus on defending against paraphrase attacks while overlooking piggyback spoofing attacks, which can inject har",
