  "title": "Adaptive Cybersecurity Architecture for Digital Product Ecosystems Using Agentic AI",
  "published": "2025-09-25T00:43:53Z",
  "summary": "Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability, real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by agentic artificial intelligence (AI).
