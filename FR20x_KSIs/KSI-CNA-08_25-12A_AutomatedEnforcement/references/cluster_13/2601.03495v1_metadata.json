  "published": "2026-01-07T01:23:13Z",
  "summary": "Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control ",
