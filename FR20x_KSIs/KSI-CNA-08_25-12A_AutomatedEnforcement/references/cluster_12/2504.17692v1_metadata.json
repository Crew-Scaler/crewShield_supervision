  "published": "2025-04-24T16:01:48Z",
  "summary": "Web browsers provide the security foundation for our online experiences. Significant research has been done into the security of browsers themselves, but relatively little investigation has been done into how they interact with the operating system or the file system. In this work, we provide the first systematic security study of browser profiles, the on-disk persistence layer of browsers, used for storing everything from users' authentication cookies and browser extensions to certificate trust",
