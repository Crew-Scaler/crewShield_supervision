  "title": "Bitcoin Cross-Chain Bridge: A Taxonomy and Its Promise in Artificial Intelligence of Things",
  "published": "2025-09-12T17:10:46Z",
  "summary": "Bitcoin's limited scripting capabilities and lack of native interoperability mechanisms have constrained its integration into the broader blockchain ecosystem, especially decentralized finance (DeFi) and multi-chain applications. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of Bitcoin cross-chain bridge protocols, systematically analyzing their trust assumptions, performance characteristics, and applicability to the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) scenarios. We categorize bridge designs",
