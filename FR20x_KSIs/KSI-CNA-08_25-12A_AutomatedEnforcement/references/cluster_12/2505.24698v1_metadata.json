  "summary": "Identity verification in Data Spaces is a fundamental aspect of ensuring security and privacy in digital environments. This paper presents an identity verification protocol tailored for shared data environments within Data Spaces. This protocol extends the Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP) and integrates OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP) along with support for Linked Verifiable Presentations (LVP), providing a robust foundation for secure and privacy-preserv",
