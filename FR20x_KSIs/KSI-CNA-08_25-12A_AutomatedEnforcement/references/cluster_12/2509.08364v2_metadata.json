  "summary": "The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the backbone of the Internet, primarily translating domain names to IP addresses. Over time, various enhancements have been introduced to strengthen the integrity of DNS. Among these, DNSSEC stands out as a leading cryptographic solution. It protects against attacks (such as DNS spoofing) by establishing a chain of trust throughout the DNS nameserver hierarchy. However, DNSSEC's effectiveness is compromised when there is a break in this chain, resulting in ",
