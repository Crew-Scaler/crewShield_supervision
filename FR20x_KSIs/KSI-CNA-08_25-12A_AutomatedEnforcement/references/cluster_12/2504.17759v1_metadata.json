  "published": "2025-04-24T17:21:00Z",
  "summary": "This paper introduces the Identity Control Plane (ICP), an architectural framework for enforcing identity-aware Zero Trust access across human users, workloads, and automation systems. The ICP model unifies SPIFFE-based workload identity, OIDC/SAML user identity, and scoped automation credentials via broker-issued transaction tokens. We propose a composable enforcement layer using ABAC policy engines (e.g., OPA, Cedar), aligned with IETF WIMSE drafts and OAuth transaction tokens. The paper inclu",
