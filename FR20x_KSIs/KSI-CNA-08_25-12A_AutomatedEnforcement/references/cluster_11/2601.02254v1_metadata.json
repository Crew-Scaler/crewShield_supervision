  "title": "Vouchsafe: A Zero-Infrastructure Capability Graph Model for Offline Identity and Trust",
  "published": "2026-01-05T16:34:47Z",
  "summary": "Modern identity and trust systems collapse in the environments where they are needed most: disaster zones, disconnected or damaged networks, and adversarial conditions such as censorship or infrastructure interference. These systems depend on functioning networks to reach online authorities, resolvers, directories, and revocation services, leaving trust unverifiable whenever communication is unavailable or untrusted. This work demonstrates that secure identity and trust are possible without such",
