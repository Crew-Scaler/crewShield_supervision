  "published": "2025-12-23T09:16:41Z",
  "summary": "The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) is currently bottlenecked by the Verifiability Trilemma, which posits that a decentralized inference system cannot simultaneously achieve high computational integrity, low latency, and low cost. Existing cryptographic solutions, such as Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML), suffer from superlinear proving overheads (O(k NlogN)) that render them infeasible for billionparameter model",
