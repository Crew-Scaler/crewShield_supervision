  "summary": "The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem has amplified concerns regarding device reliability, interoperability, and security assurance. Despite the proliferation of IoT security guidelines, a unified and quantitative approach to measuring trust remains absent. This paper introduces SCI-IoT (Secure Certification Index for IoT), a standardized and quantitative framework for trust scoring, evaluation, and certification of IoT devices.\n  The framework employs a six-tier gradi",
