  "summary": "The rise of autonomous AI agents in enterprise and industrial environments introduces a critical challenge: how to securely assign, verify, and manage their identities across distributed systems. Existing identity frameworks based on API keys, certificates, or application-layer credentials lack the infrastructure-grade trust, lifecycle control, and interoperability needed to manage agents operating independently in sensitive contexts.\n  In this paper, we propose a conceptual architecture that le",
