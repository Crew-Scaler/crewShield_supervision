  "title": "ThinkTrap: Denial-of-Service Attacks against Black-box LLM Services via Infinite Thinking",
  "published": "2025-12-08T01:41:57Z",
  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational components in a wide range of applications, including natural language understanding and generation, embodied intelligence, and scientific discovery. As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning,",
