  "summary": "Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed. However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets, which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve transparency in organizations that handle confidential data ",
