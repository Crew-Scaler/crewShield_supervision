  "summary": "As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, they accumulate and manage various personal data, thereby presenting a key challenge in preserving privacy during data sharing and processing. This survey reviews applications of Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) that address these privacy concerns in the automotive domain. First, we identify the scope of privacy-sensitive use cases for these technologies, by surveying existing works that address privacy",
