  "title": "ADA: Automated Moving Target Defense for AI Workloads via Ephemeral Infrastructure-Native Rotation in Kubernetes",
  "published": "2025-05-27T02:24:45Z",
  "summary": "This paper introduces the Adaptive Defense Agent (ADA), an innovative Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) system designed to fundamentally enhance the security posture of AI workloads. ADA operates by continuously and automatically rotating these workloads at the infrastructure level, leveraging the inherent ephemerality of Kubernetes pods. This constant managed churn systematically invalidates attacker assumptions and disrupts potential kill chains by regularly destroying and respawning AI s",
