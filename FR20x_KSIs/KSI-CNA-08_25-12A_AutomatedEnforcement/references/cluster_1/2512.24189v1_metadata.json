  "title": "SCP: Accelerating Discovery with a Global Web of Autonomous Scientific Agents",
  "published": "2025-12-30T12:45:32Z",
  "summary": "We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, ca",
