  "published": "2025-07-10T04:17:29Z",
  "summary": "Critical infrastructure systems, including energy grids, healthcare facilities, transportation networks, and water distribution systems, are pivotal to societal stability and economic resilience. However, the increasing interconnectivity of these systems exposes them to various cyber threats, including ransomware, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This paper examines cybersecurity vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, highlighting the threat landscape",
