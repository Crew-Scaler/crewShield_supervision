  "title": "AI-Driven Dynamic Firewall Optimization Using Reinforcement Learning for Anomaly Detection and Prevention",
  "published": "2025-05-21T17:05:33Z",
  "summary": "The growing complexity of cyber threats has rendered static firewalls increasingly ineffective for dynamic, real-time intrusion prevention. This paper proposes a novel AI-driven dynamic firewall optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to autonomously adapt and update firewall rules in response to evolving network threats. Our system employs a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, where the RL agent observes network states, detects anomalies using a hybrid LST",
