  "summary": "Cyber Security Incident Response (IR) Playbooks are used to capture the steps required to recover from a cyber intrusion. Individual IR playbooks should focus on a specific type of incident and be aligned with the architecture of a system under attack. Intrusion modelling focuses on a specific potential cyber intrusion and is used to identify where and what countermeasures are needed, and the resulting intrusion models are expected to be used in effective IR, ideally by feeding IR Playbooks desi",
