  "summary": "Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires models capable of integrating macro-scale neuroanatomical alterations with micro-scale genetic susceptibility, yet existing multimodal approaches struggle to align these heterogeneous signals. We introduce R-GenIMA, an interpretable multimodal large language model that couples a novel ROI-wise vision transformer with genetic prompting to jointly model structural MRI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variations. By representing each an",
