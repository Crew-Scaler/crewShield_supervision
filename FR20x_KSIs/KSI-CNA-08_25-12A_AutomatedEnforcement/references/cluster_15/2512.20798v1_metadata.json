  "title": "A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents",
  "published": "2025-12-23T21:52:53Z",
  "summary": "As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents purs",
