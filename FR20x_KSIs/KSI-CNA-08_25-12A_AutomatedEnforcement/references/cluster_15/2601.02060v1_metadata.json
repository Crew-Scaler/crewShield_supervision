  "title": "Perish or Flourish? A Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation in Functional Programming",
  "published": "2026-01-05T12:33:37Z",
  "summary": "Functional programming provides strong foundations for developing reliable and secure software systems, yet its adoption remains not widespread due to the steep learning curve. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we intr",
