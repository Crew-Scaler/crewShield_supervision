  "title": "Integrating Multi-Agent Simulation, Behavioral Forensics, and Trust-Aware Machine Learning for Adaptive Insider Threat Detection",
  "published": "2026-01-06T01:57:10Z",
  "summary": "We present a hybrid framework for adaptive insider-threat detection that tightly integrates multi-agent simulation (MAS), layered Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) correlation, behavioral and communication forensics, trust-aware machine learning, and Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning. Intelligent agents operate in a simulated enterprise environment, generating both behavioral events and cognitive intent signals that are ingested by a centralized SIEM. We evaluate four system variants",
