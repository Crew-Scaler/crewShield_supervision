  "summary": "Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) represents a transformative approach to modern cybersecurity, directly addressing the shortcomings of traditional perimeter-based security models. With the rise of cloud computing, remote work, and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, perimeter defenses have proven ineffective at mitigating risks, particularly those involving insider threats and lateral movement within networks. ZTA shifts the security paradigm by assuming that no user, device, or system can be",
