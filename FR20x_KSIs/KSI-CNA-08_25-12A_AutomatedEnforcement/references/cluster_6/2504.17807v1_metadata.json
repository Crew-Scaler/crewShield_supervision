  "title": "Research on Cloud Platform Network Traffic Monitoring and Anomaly Detection System based on Large Language Models",
  "published": "2025-04-22T07:42:07Z",
  "summary": "The rapidly evolving cloud platforms and the escalating complexity of network traffic demand proper network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection to ensure network security and performance. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM)-based network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system. In addition to existing models such as autoencoders and decision trees, we harness the power of large language models for processing sequence data from network traffic, which allows us a better",
