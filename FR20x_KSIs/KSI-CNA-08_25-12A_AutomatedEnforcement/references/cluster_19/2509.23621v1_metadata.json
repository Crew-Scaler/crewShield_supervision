  "published": "2025-09-28T03:52:46Z",
  "summary": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a promising paradigm for automating machine learning (ML) pipeline design, broadening AI adoption. Yet its reliability in complex domains such as cybersecurity remains underexplored. This paper systematically evaluates eight open-source AutoML frameworks across 11 publicly available cybersecurity datasets, spanning intrusion detection, malware classification, phishing, fraud detection, and spam filtering. Results show substantial performance var",
