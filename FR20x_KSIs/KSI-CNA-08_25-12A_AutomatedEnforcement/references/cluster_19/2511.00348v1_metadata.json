  "published": "2025-11-01T01:23:32Z",
  "summary": "An automated, standoff acoustic leak detection scheme has been designed, built, and tested. It merges the principles of glass breakage and smoke detection to alert for the presence of leaks emanating from pressurized plumbing. A simulated water leak flowing at 0.15 l/min has been reliably detected at a standoff distance of more than 10 m. The device is also effective at identifying the presence of leaks located behind surfaces such as walls, doors, floors, and ceilings. The anticipated applicati",
