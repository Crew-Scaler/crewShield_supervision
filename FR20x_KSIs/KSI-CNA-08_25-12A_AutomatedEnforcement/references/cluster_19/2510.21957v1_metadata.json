  "summary": "Ransomware has become a critical threat to cybersecurity due to its rapid evolution, the necessity for early detection, and growing diversity, posing significant challenges to traditional detection methods. While AI-based approaches had been proposed by prior works to assist ransomware detection, existing methods suffer from three major limitations, ad-hoc feature dependencies, delayed response, and limited adaptability to unseen variants. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates se",
