  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in domains including cloud security and forensics. Yet cloud forensic investigations still rely on manual analysis, making them time-consuming and error-prone. LLMs can mimic human reasoning, offering a pathway to automating cloud log analysis. To address this, we introduce the Cloud Investigation Automation Framework (CIAF), an ontology-driven framework that systematically investigates cloud forensic logs while improving efficiency and accurac",
