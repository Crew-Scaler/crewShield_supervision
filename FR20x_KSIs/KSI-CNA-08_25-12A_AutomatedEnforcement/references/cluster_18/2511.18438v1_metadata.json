  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agent systems have recently demonstrated strong potential in automating code reasoning and vulnerability detection. However, when applied to large-scale firmware, their performance degrades due to the binary nature of firmware, complex dependency structures, and heterogeneous components. To address this challenge, this paper presents FIRMHIVE, a recursive agent hive that enables LLMs to act as autonomous firmware security analysts. FIRMHIVE introduces two k",
