  "title": "AudAgent: Automated Auditing of Privacy Policy Compliance in AI Agents",
  "published": "2025-11-03T17:32:08Z",
  "summary": "AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual tool that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance",
