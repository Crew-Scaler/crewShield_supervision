  "title": "Secure and Explainable Fraud Detection in Finance via Hierarchical Multi-source Dataset Distillation",
  "published": "2025-12-26T05:00:35Z",
  "summary": "We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggr",
