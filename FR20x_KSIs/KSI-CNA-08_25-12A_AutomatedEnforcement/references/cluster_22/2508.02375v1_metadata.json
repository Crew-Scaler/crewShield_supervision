  "summary": "Operational Technology (OT) is an integral component of critical national infrastructure, enabling automation and control in industries such as energy, manufacturing, and transportation. However, OT networks, systems, and devices have been designed and deployed prioritising functionality rather than security. This leads to inherent vulnerabilities in many deployed systems when operational misconfigurations expose them to the internet. This report provides an up-to-date overview of the OT threat ",
