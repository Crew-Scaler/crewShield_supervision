  "published": "2025-09-19T13:17:16Z",
  "summary": "Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration between LLMs and external tools.\n  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital setting.\n  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated",
