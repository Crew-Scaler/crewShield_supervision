  "published": "2025-12-29T05:45:57Z",
  "summary": "Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is emerging as a foundational paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, enabling communication infrastructures to simultaneously support data transmission and environment sensing. By tightly coupling radio sensing with communication functions, ISAC unlocks new capabilities for situational awareness, localization, tracking, and network adaptation. At the same time, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of future wireless systems deman",
