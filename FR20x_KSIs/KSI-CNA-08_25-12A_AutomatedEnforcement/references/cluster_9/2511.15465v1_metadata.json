  "published": "2025-11-19T14:24:15Z",
  "summary": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks enable unconditionally secure key exchange using quantum mechanical principles. However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared",
