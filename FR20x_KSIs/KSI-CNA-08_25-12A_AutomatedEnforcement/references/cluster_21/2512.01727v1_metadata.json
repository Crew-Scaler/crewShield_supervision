  "title": "AI-Driven Cybersecurity Testbed for Nuclear Infrastructure: Comprehensive Evaluation Using METL Operational Data",
  "published": "2025-12-01T14:36:52Z",
  "summary": "Advanced nuclear reactor systems face increasing cybersecurity threats as sophisticated attackers exploit cyber-physical interfaces to manipulate control systems while evading traditional IT security measures. This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of artificial intelligence approaches for cybersecurity protection in nuclear infrastructure, using Argonne National Laboratory's Mechanisms Engineering Test Loop (METL) as an experimental platform. We developed a systematic evaluation fram",
