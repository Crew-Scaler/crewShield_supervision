  "summary": "Threat modeling plays a critical role in the identification and mitigation of security risks; however, manual approaches are often labor intensive and prone to error. This paper investigates the automation of software threat modeling through the clustering of call graphs using density-based and community detection algorithms, followed by an analysis of the threats associated with the identified clusters. The proposed method was evaluated through a case study of the Splunk Forwarder Operator (SFO",
