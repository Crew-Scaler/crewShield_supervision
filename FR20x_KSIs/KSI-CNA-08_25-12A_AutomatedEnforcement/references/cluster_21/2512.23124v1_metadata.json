  "title": "SecureBank: A Financially-Aware Zero Trust Architecture for High-Assurance Banking Systems",
  "published": "2025-12-29T00:53:18Z",
  "summary": "Financial institutions increasingly rely on distributed architectures, open banking APIs, cloud native infrastructures, and high frequency digital transactions. These transformations expand the attack surface and expose limitations in traditional perimeter based security models. While Zero Trust architectures provide essential security principles, most existing frameworks do not explicitly incorporate transactional semantics, financial risk modeling, adaptive identity trust, or automation weight",
