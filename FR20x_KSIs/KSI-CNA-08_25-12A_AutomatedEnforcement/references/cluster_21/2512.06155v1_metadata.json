  "summary": "Security research is fundamentally a problem of resource constraint and consequent prioritization. There is simply too much attack surface and too little time and energy to spend analyzing it all. The most effective security researchers are often those who are most skilled at intuitively deciding which part of an expansive attack surface to investigate. We demonstrate that this problem of selecting the most promising option from among many possibilities can be reframed as an information retrieva",
