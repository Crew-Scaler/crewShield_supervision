  "summary": "It is well known that encryption alone is not enough to protect data privacy. Access patterns, revealed when operations are performed, can also be leveraged in inference attacks. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides access patterns by making client requests oblivious. However, existing protocols are still limited in supporting concurrent clients and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). We present MVP-ORAM, the first wait-free ORAM protocol that supports concurrent fail-prone clients. In contrast to previous w",
