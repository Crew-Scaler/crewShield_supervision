  "published": "2025-05-26T06:44:31Z",
  "summary": "This paper focuses on Zero-Trust Foundation Models (ZTFMs), a novel paradigm that embeds zero-trust security principles into the lifecycle of foundation models (FMs) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By integrating core tenets, such as continuous verification, least privilege access (LPA), data confidentiality, and behavioral analytics into the design, training, and deployment of FMs, ZTFMs can enable secure, privacy-preserving AI across distributed, heterogeneous, and potentially adversaria",
