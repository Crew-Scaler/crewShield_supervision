### 1. SBOMproof: Beyond Alleged SBOM Compliance for Supply Chain Security of Container Images

**ArXiv ID**: 2510.05798v1
**Publication Date**: 2025-10-07
**Page Count**: 18 pages

**Abstract Summary**:
Supply chain security is extremely important for modern applications running at scale in the cloud. In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software bill of material (SBOM) with end users ...

**Publication Date**: 2024-09-10
**Page Count**: 23 pages
**Authors**: Giacomo Benedetti, Serena Cofano, Alessandro Brighente, Mauro Conti

**Abstract Summary**:
The Software Supply Chain (SSC) security is a critical concern for both users and developers. Recent incidents, like the SolarWinds Orion compromise, proved the widespread impact resulting from the distribution of compromised software. The reliance on open-source components, which constitute a significant portion of modern software, further exacerbates this risk. To enhance SSC security, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has been promoted as a tool to increase transparency and verifiabili...

### 3. Trustworthy and Confidential SBOM Exchange

**ArXiv ID**: 2509.13217v1
**Publication Date**: 2025-09-16
**Page Count**: 20 pages
**Authors**: Eman Abu Ishgair, Chinenye Okafor, Marcela S. Melara, Santiago Torres-Arias

**Abstract Summary**:
Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become a regulatory requirement for improving software supply chain security and trust by means of transparency regarding components that make up software artifacts. However, enterprise and regulated software vendors commonly wish to restrict who can view confidential software metadata recorded in their SBOMs due to intellectual property or security vulnerability information. To address this tension between transparency and confidentiality, we propose ...

### 4. A Reality Check on SBOM-based Vulnerability Management: An Empirical Study and A Path Forward

**ArXiv ID**: 2511.20313v1
**Publication Date**: 2025-11-25
**Page Count**: 12 pages
**Authors**: Li Zhou, Marc Dacier, Charalambos Konstantinou

**Abstract Summary**:
The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a critical tool for securing the software supply chain (SSC), but its practical utility is undermined by inaccuracies in both its generation and its application in vulnerability scanning. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study on 2,414 open-source repositories to address these issues from a practical standpoint. First, we demonstrate that using lock files with strong package managers enables the generation of accurate and consistent SBOMs, e...

**Publication Date**: 2025-07-28
**Page Count**: 11 pages
**Authors**: Howell Xia, Jonah Gluck, Sevval Simsek, David Sastre Medina, David Starobinski

**Abstract Summary**:
The high complexity of modern software supply chains necessitates tools such as Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to manage component dependencies, and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerabilities. While there exists limited integration between SBOMs and SCA tools, a unified view of complex dependency-vulnerability relationships remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce VDGraph, a novel knowledge graph-based methodology for integrating vulnerability and dependency...

**Publication Date**: 2025-08-19
**Page Count**: 15 pages
**Authors**: Eric Cornelissen, Musard Balliu

**Abstract Summary**:
The software supply chain is an increasingly common attack vector for malicious actors. The Node.js ecosystem has been subject to a wide array of attacks, likely due to its size and prevalence. To counter such attacks, the research community and practitioners have proposed a range of static and dynamic mechanisms, including process- and language-level sandboxing, permission systems, and taint tracking. Drawing on valuable insight from these works, this paper studies a runtime protection mecha...

**Publication Date**: 2024-02-14
**Page Count**: 14 pages
**Authors**: Bharathi Seshadri, Yongkui Han, Chris Olson, David Pollak, Vojislav Tomasevic

**Abstract Summary**:
Software supply chain attacks, which exploit the build process or artifacts used in the process of building a software product, are increasingly of concern. To combat these attacks, one must be able to check that every artifact that a software product depends on does not contain vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce OmniBOR, (Universal Bill of Receipts) a minimalistic scheme for build tools to create an artifact dependency graph which can be used to track every software artifact incorp...
