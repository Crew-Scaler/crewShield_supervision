**KSI-AIM-04-Q01:** What governance procedures ensure AI audit logging architecture evolves with regulatory requirements and threat landscape? Document: (a) regulatory monitoring (tracking new requirements), (b) quarterly/annual assessments of alignment, (c) roadmap for implementing new capabilities, (d) stakeholder feedback mechanisms (security, compliance, customers), (e) investment and timeline for governance evolution.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q02:** How do you measure and communicate audit logging effectiveness through KPIs and reporting? Provide: (a) KPIs tracked (log completeness, latency, storage cost, analysis accuracy), (b) dashboards for operations teams, (c) reporting to security leadership and board, (d) benchmarking against peers, (e) continuous improvement based on metrics.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q03:** What cost-benefit analysis justifies your AI audit logging architecture decision (dedicated system vs. SIEM extension)? Provide: (a) current annual spend (SIEM, logging infrastructure), (b) projected AI system growth (number of models, inference volume), (c) cost comparison (dedicated vs. SIEM extension), (d) ROI analysis (compliance risk reduction, incident response improvement), (e) phased investment roadmap (phases 1-4 with financial projections).

**KSI-AIM-04-Q04:** What documented attribution policy specifies who receives credit when AI systems discover vulnerabilities, and how does this affect responsibility allocation? Document: (a) attribution criteria (full AI credit, operator credit, organizational credit, shared credit model), (b) impact on bounty allocation and payment mechanisms (who receives financial incentives?), (c) responsibility assignment framework (who is liable if vulnerability is exploited?), (d) evidence of clear policy reducing disputes, (e) alignment with industry emerging frameworks and standards.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q05:** How do you address emerging questions about AI agent accountability when agents make autonomous discovery and disclosure decisions? Document: (a) organizational accountability framework specifying who is ultimately liable, (b) insurance coverage and protection mechanisms for AI-driven decisions, (c) transparency communications to customers about AI involvement in discovery, (d) disclosure procedures for informing customers of AI use in vulnerability discovery, (e) governance structure and oversight assigning responsibility and enabling escalation.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q06:** What continuous evolution of your attribution and responsibility frameworks keeps pace with emerging industry norms as AI discovery becomes ubiquitous? Describe: (a) monitoring mechanisms tracking industry attribution standards development, (b) quarterly/annual governance framework reviews and update cycles, (c) stakeholder feedback mechanisms (vendors, researchers, customers, regulators), (d) improvement roadmap with timelines for framework evolution, (e) communication procedures informing stakeholders of policy changes and rationale.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q07:** How does the organization balance aggressive compliance timelines (CRA 2027, DORA 2025) with avoiding hasty deployment of immature autonomous defense systems? Address: (a) governance framework assessing autonomy maturity vs. compliance timeline pressures, (b) risk acceptance procedures for deploying partially-mature autonomous agents, (c) rollback and exit strategies if autonomous systems prove unreliable, (d) stakeholder communication about compliance-driven autonomy tradeoffs, (e) metrics tracking autonomy maturity improvements, (f) regulatory coordination ensuring compliance deadlines don't force unsafe deployments.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q08:** How does the organization establish liability and insurance coverage for autonomous agent decisions that block legitimate libraries or remediate supplier relationships? Address: (a) legal framework assigning accountability for autonomous agent decisions, (b) insurance coverage for autonomous decision failures (false positives, over-remediation), (c) customer indemnification and liability allocation, (d) transparency communications to customers about AI/autonomous system involvement in supply chain decisions, (e) governance structure and oversight assigning decision authority and enabling escalation, (f) post-incident liability assessment procedures when autonomous decisions cause business impact.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q09:** For multi-agent recovery orchestration and AI system coordination, what governance framework prevents agent-to-agent trust exploitation where one compromised agent manipulates others to execute malicious actions? Address: (a) trust establishment and verification mechanisms between agents, (b) detection procedures for identifying compromised agents before lateral influence, (c) isolation and containment procedures if trust relationships are compromised, (d) governance procedures specifying which inter-agent communications are allowed and which are prohibited, (e) audit trails documenting all agent-to-agent interactions enabling forensics if compromise is suspected, (f) regular validation that trust frameworks remain aligned with threat landscape.

**KSI-AIM-04-Q10:** Does the EU AI Act (effective August 2026) require explainability of backup scheduling decisions made by AI models? Can the organization explain to regulators why AI models recommended specific RPO values, backup frequency, recovery prioritization, or other critical backup parameters, and provide audit evidence demonstrating explainability compliance?
