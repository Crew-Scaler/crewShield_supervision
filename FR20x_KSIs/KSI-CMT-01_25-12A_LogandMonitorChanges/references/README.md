## Key Research Findings

### Validated Claims from Survey

✅ **10-Year Retention Mandate**
- EU AI Act Article 18: Technical documentation retained 10 years
- EU AI Act Article 12/19: System logs minimum 6 months
- Applies to high-risk AI systems

✅ **Shared Responsibility Gaps**
- 99% of cloud security failures are customer fault (Gartner)
- Unclear boundary: infrastructure vs. AI-specific logging
- CSP vs. customer accountability for AI audit trails

✅ **Audit Procedures**
- EU AI Act requires: input data, model version, output, human oversight logs
- Must be immutable, tamper-evident, searchable, retention-compliant
- Regulators audit logs AND logging systems

## Usage

These papers support the log monitoring survey ([../1_KSI-CMT-01_25-12A_LogandMonitorChanges_survey.md](../1_KSI-CMT-01_25-12A_LogandMonitorChanges_survey.md)) by providing:

1. **Regulatory Evidence**: EU AI Act Article 12 compliance requirements
2. **Technical Standards**: Logging architectures, observability frameworks
3. **Industry Cases**: Real-world implementations (IBM Cloud, healthcare, critical infrastructure)
4. **Gap Analysis**: Shared responsibility model challenges
5. **Best Practices**: Governance frameworks, audit methodologies
