## Key Validation Findings

### 10-Year Retention Mandate (VALIDATED)
- **EU AI Act Article 18**: Providers must retain technical documentation for **10 years** after high-risk AI system placement
- **EU AI Act Article 12/19**: System logs must be retained for **minimum 6 months**, or longer based on intended purpose
- **Distinction**: 10-year rule applies to documentation/metadata, not raw operational logs

### Shared Responsibility Gaps (VALIDATED)
- Gartner statistic: **99% of cloud security failures are customer fault** through 2025
- Boundary unclear for AI: CSP vs. customer logging responsibilities for AI workloads
- Gap: Infrastructure logging (CSP) vs. application/data logging (customer) vs. AI-specific logging (unclear)

### Actual Audit Procedures (VALIDATED)
- EU AI Act requires demonstrable audit trails: input data, model version, output, human oversight
- Audit trails must be: immutable, tamper-evident, searchable, retention-compliant
- Regulators audit both the logs AND the logging system itself
- Industry readiness gap: Most companies lack audit trails, access controls, AI-specific monitoring
