RESEARCH GAPS & OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

Area 1: SHADOW AI SYSTEMS
Current State: Limited literature on unmanaged AI tool usage
Opportunity: Research employee-deployed AI systems and shadow AI risks

Area 2: CREDENTIAL EXPOSURE IN AI CONTEXT
Current State: Few papers on secret exposure through AI services
Opportunity: Focus on API credential theft and misuse prevention

Area 3: AI-ENABLED RECONNAISSANCE
Current State: Minimal research on automated information gathering
Opportunity: Study AI tool misuse for reconnaissance activities

Area 4: CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL DETECTION
Current State: Most papers focus on single enterprise scenarios
Opportunity: Develop federated frameworks for multi-org threat detection
