    "summary": "We present Facade (Fast and Accurate Contextual Anomaly DEtection): a high-precision deep-learning-based anomaly detection system deployed at Google (a large technology company) as the last line of defense against insider threats since 2018. Facade is an innovative unsupervised action-context system that detects suspicious actions by considering the context surrounding each action, including relevant facts about the user and other entities involved. It is built around a new multi-modal model that is trained on corporate document access, SQL query, and HTTP/RPC request logs.   To overcome the scarcity of incident data, Facade harnesses a novel contrastive learning strategy that relies solely on benign data. Its use of history and implicit social network featurization efficiently handles the frequent out-of-distribution events that occur in a rapidly changing corporate environment, and sustains Facade's high precision performance for a full year after training. Beyond the core model, Facade contributes an innovative clustering approach based on user and action embeddings to improve detection robustness and achieve high precision, multi-scale detection.   Functionally what sets Facade apart from existing anomaly detection systems is its high precision. It detects insider attackers with an extremely low false positive rate, lower than 0.01%. For single rogue actions, such as the illegitimate access to a sensitive document, the false positive rate is as low as 0.0003%. To the best of our knowledge, Facade is the only published insider risk anomaly detection system that helps secure such a large corporate environment.",

    "summary": "Graph anomaly detection has gained significant attention across various domains, particularly in critical applications like fraud detection in e-commerce platforms and insider threat detection in cybersecurity. Usually, these data are composed of multiple types (e.g., user information and transaction records for financial data), thus exhibiting view heterogeneity. However, in the era of big data, the heterogeneity of views and the lack of label information pose substantial challenges to traditional approaches. Existing unsupervised graph anomaly detection methods often struggle with high-dimensionality issues, rely on strong assumptions about graph structures or fail to handle complex multi-view graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a cluster aware multi-view graph anomaly detection method, called CARE. Our approach captures both local and global node affinities by augmenting the graph's adjacency matrix with the pseudo-label (i.e., soft membership assignments) without any strong assumption about the graph. To mitigate potential biases from the pseudo-label, we introduce a similarity-guided loss. Theoretically, we show that the proposed similarity-guided loss is a variant of contrastive learning loss, and we present how this loss alleviates the bias introduced by pseudo-label with the connection to graph spectral clustering. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Specifically, CARE outperforms the second-best competitors by more than 39% on the Amazon dataset with respect to AUPRC and 18.7% on the YelpChi dataset with respect to AUROC. The code of our method is available at the GitHub link: https://github.com/zhenglecheng/CARE-demo.",

    "summary": "Enterprises and organizations are faced with potential threats from insider employees that may lead to serious consequences. Previous studies on insider threat detection (ITD) mainly focus on detecting abnormal users or abnormal time periods (e.g., a week or a day). However, a user may have hundreds of thousands of activities in the log, and even within a day there may exist thousands of activities for a user, requiring a high investigation budget to verify abnormal users or activities given the detection results. On the other hand, existing works are mainly post-hoc methods rather than real-time detection, which can not report insider threats in time before they cause loss. In this paper, we conduct the first study towards real-time ITD at activity level, and present a fine-grained and efficient framework LAN. Specifically, LAN simultaneously learns the temporal dependencies within an activity sequence and the relationships between activities across sequences with graph structure learning. Moreover, to mitigate the data imbalance problem in ITD, we propose a novel hybrid prediction loss, which integrates self-supervision signals from normal activities and supervision signals from abnormal activities into a unified loss for anomaly detection. We evaluate the performance of LAN on two widely used datasets, i.e., CERT r4.2 and CERT r5.2. Extensive and comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of LAN, outperforming 9 state-of-the-art baselines by at least 9.92% and 6.35% in AUC for real-time ITD on CERT r4.2 and r5.2, respectively. Moreover, LAN can be also applied to post-hoc ITD, surpassing 8 competitive baselines by at least 7.70% and 4.03% in AUC on two datasets. Finally, the ablation study, parameter analysis, and compatibility analysis evaluate the impact of each module and hyper-parameter in LAN.

Additionally, we look at how penetration testing is used in different industries, present case studies with real-world implementations, and discuss the obstacles and constraints that businesses must overcome. This study aims to improve the knowledge of penetration testing as a critical part of insider threat defense, helping to create more comprehensive and successful security policies.",

    "summary": "In recent years, insider threats and attacks have been increasing in terms of frequency and cost to the corporate business. The utilization of end-to-end encrypted instant messaging applications (WhatsApp, Telegram, VPN) by malicious insiders raised data breach incidents exponentially. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) investigated reports on such data leak incidents and reported about twelve companies where earnings data and financial information were leaked using WhatsApp messages. Recent surveys indicate that 60% of data breaches are primarily caused by malicious insider threats. Especially, in the case of the defense environment, information leaks by insiders will jeopardize the countrys national security. Sniffing of network and host-based activities will not work in an insider threat detection environment due to end-to-end encryption. Memory forensics allows access to the messages sent or received over an end-to-end encrypted environment but with a total compromise of the users privacy. In this research, we present a novel solution to detect data leakages by insiders in an organization. Our approach captures the RAM of the insiders device and analyses it for sensitive information leaks from a host system while maintaining the users privacy. Sensitive data leaks are identified with context using a deep learning model. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed idea have been demonstrated with the help of a military use case. The proposed architecture can however be used across various use cases with minor modifications.",

    "summary": "In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) and data sharing, users frequently upload their personal information to enterprise databases to enjoy enhanced service experiences provided by various online services. However, the widespread presence of system vulnerabilities, remote network intrusions, and insider threats significantly increases the exposure of private enterprise data on the internet. If such data is stolen or leaked by attackers, it can result in severe asset losses and business operation disruptions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel threat detection framework, TabITD. This framework integrates Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) strategies to form a collaborative detection system that bridges the gaps in existing systems' capabilities. It effectively addresses the blurred boundaries between external and insider threats caused by the diversification of attack methods, thereby enhancing the model's learning ability and overall detection performance. Moreover, the proposed method leverages the TabNet architecture, which employs a sparse attention feature selection mechanism that allows TabNet to select the most relevant features at each decision step, thereby improving the detection of rare-class attacks. We evaluated our proposed solution on two different datasets, achieving average accuracies of 96.71% and 97.25%, respectively. The results demonstrate that this approach can effectively detect malicious behaviors such as masquerade attacks and external threats, significantly enhancing network security defenses and the efficiency of network attack detection.",

    "summary": "Insider threats usually occur from within the workplace, where the attacker is an entity closely associated with the organization. The sequence of actions the entities take on the resources to which they have access rights allows us to identify the insiders. Insider Threat Detection (ITD) using Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches gained attention in the last few years. However, most techniques employed centralized ML methods to perform such an ITD. Organizations operating from multiple locations cannot contribute to the centralized models as the data is generated from various locations. In particular, the user behavior data, which is the primary source of ITD, cannot be shared among the locations due to privacy concerns. Additionally, the data distributed across various locations result in extreme class imbalance due to the rarity of attacks. Federated Learning (FL), a distributed data modeling paradigm, gained much interest recently. However, FL-enabled ITD is not yet explored, and it still needs research to study the significant issues of its implementation in practical settings. As such, our work investigates an FL-enabled multiclass ITD paradigm that considers non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distribution to detect insider threats from different locations (clients) of an organization. Specifically, we propose a Federated Adversarial Training (FedAT) approach using a generative model to alleviate the extreme data skewness arising from the non-IID data distribution among the clients. Besides, we propose to utilize a Self-normalized Neural Network-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (SNN-MLP) model to improve ITD. We perform comprehensive experiments and compare the results with the benchmarks to manifest the enhanced performance of the proposed FedATdriven ITD scheme.",

    "summary": "Log-based insider threat detection (ITD) detects malicious user activities by auditing log entries. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with strong common sense knowledge have emerged in the domain of ITD. Nevertheless, diverse activity types and overlong log files pose a significant challenge for LLMs in directly discerning malicious ones within myriads of normal activities. Furthermore, the faithfulness hallucination issue from LLMs aggravates its application difficulty in ITD, as the generated conclusion may not align with user commands and activity context. In response to these challenges, we introduce Audit-LLM, a multi-agent log-based insider threat detection framework comprising three collaborative agents: (i) the Decomposer agent, breaking down the complex ITD task into manageable sub-tasks using Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning;(ii) the Tool Builder agent, creating reusable tools for sub-tasks to overcome context length limitations in LLMs; and (iii) the Executor agent, generating the final detection conclusion by invoking constructed tools. To enhance conclusion accuracy, we propose a pair-wise Evidence-based Multi-agent Debate (EMAD) mechanism, where two independent Executors iteratively refine their conclusions through reasoning exchange to reach a consensus. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three publicly available ITD datasets-CERT r4.2, CERT r5.2, and PicoDomain-demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing baselines and show that the proposed EMAD significantly improves the faithfulness of explanations generated by LLMs.",

Our goal is to assist auditors in identifying agent actions that cannot be explained by the activity within their surrounding context, where normal activity patterns are established from historical data. We apply our method to help audit millions of actions of over three thousand support agents.   We collect logs from the tools used by support agents and construct a bipartite graph of Actions and Entities representing all the actions of the agents, as well as background information about entities. From this graph, we sample subgraphs rooted on security-significant actions taken by the agents. Each subgraph captures the relevant context of the root action in terms of other actions, entities and their relationships. We then prioritize the rooted-subgraphs for auditor review using feed-forward and graph neural networks, as well as nearest neighbors techniques. To alleviate the issue of scarce labeling data, we use contrastive learning and domain-specific data augmentations.   Expert auditors label the top ranked subgraphs as ``worth auditing\" or ``not worth auditing\" based on the company's business policies. This system finds subgraphs that are worth auditing with high enough precision to be used in production.",

As AI technologies advance, ethical considerations, transparency, data privacy, and their impact on human labor intersect with the drive for innovation and efficiency. Our research explores publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) that often operate on the periphery, away from mainstream scrutiny. These lesser-known models have received limited scholarly analysis and may lack comprehensive restrictions and safeguards. Specifically, we examine Gab AI, a platform that centers around unrestricted communication and privacy, allowing users to interact freely without censorship. Generative AI chatbots are increasingly prevalent, but cybersecurity risks have also escalated. Organizations must carefully navigate this evolving landscape by implementing transparent AI usage policies. Frequent training and policy updates are essential to adapt to emerging threats. Insider threats, whether malicious or unwitting, continue to pose one of the most significant cybersecurity challenges in the workplace. Our research is on the lesser-known publicly accessible LLMs and their implications for workplace policies.

We model the protocol's components, including trust relationships, secure channels, and adversary capabilities under the Dolev-Yao model. Verification results confirm the protocol's robustness against common attacks such as message tampering, impersonation, and replay. Additionally, dependency graphs and detailed proofs demonstrate the successful enforcement of security properties like voucher authenticity, data confidentiality, and key integrity. The study identifies potential enhancements, such as incorporating timestamp-based validity checks and augmenting mutual authentication mechanisms to address insider threats and key management challenges.

These measures are essential for maintaining the integrity and accessibility of data, effectively guarding against threats like ransomware attacks that focus on encrypting large volumes of stored data, as well as insider threats that involve tampering with or erasing system and access logs. Such protection measures have become crucial in today's landscape, and hardware-based solutions like Write-Once Read-Many (WORM) storage devices, have been put forth as viable options, which however impose hardware-level investments, and the impossibility to reuse the blocks of the storage devices after they have been written. In this article we propose VaultFS, a Linux-suited file system oriented to the maintenance of cold-data, namely data that are written using a common file system interface, are kept accessible, but are not modifiable, even by threads running with (effective)root-id. Essentially, these files are supported via the write-once semantic, and cannot be subject to the rewriting (or deletion) of their content up to the end of their (potentially infinite) protection life time. Hence they cannot be subject to ransomware attacks even under privilege escalation. This takes place with no need for any underlying WORM device -- since ValutFS is a pure software solution working with common read/write devices (e.g., hard disks and SSD). Also, VaultFS offers the possibility to protect the storage against Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks, possibly caused by un-trusted applications that simply write on the file system to make its device blocks busy with non-removable content.",
