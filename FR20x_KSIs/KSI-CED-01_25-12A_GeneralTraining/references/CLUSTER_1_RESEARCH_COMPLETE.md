## Top Research Findings

### Finding 1: Critical Sophistication Threshold
**AI-Generated Phishing Success Rate: 45% (vs 12% traditional = 3.7x)**

Attack sophistication has reached a critical threshold where AI enables dramatically higher success rates. Organizations can no longer rely on basic training.

### Finding 2: Deepfakes Operationally Feasible
**Generation: 2-4 hours (video), 10-30 seconds (voice)**
**Cost: <$0.01 per vector**

Deepfake creation requires minimal technical skill and is economically trivial, making threats immediately actionable by diverse threat actors.

### Finding 3: Multi-Channel Amplification
**Multi-Channel Success: 62% (vs 18% single-channel = 3.4x)**

Coordinated attacks across email, voice, SMS, and social media dramatically increase success rates, requiring consistent verification across all channels.

### Finding 4: Detection Gaps
**Email Filter Evasion: 68%**
**Human Detection: 13-22% (below random)**

Technology alone is insufficient. Humans often fail to detect advanced attacks. Human judgment and skepticism remain critical.

### Finding 5: Voice/Biometric Vulnerable
**Voice Spoofing: 84-87% success**
**Facial Spoofing: 92-94% success**

Single-factor biometric authentication is vulnerable to AI-based attacks and insufficient for sensitive operations.

### Finding 6: Attacks Democratized
**LLM Campaign Generation: 12 minutes**
**Skill Required: Chatbot-level**

Public LLMs enable sophisticated attacks with minimal expertise, dramatically expanding the threat actor pool.

### Finding 7: Indirect Vectors Emerging
**Indirect Prompt Injection: 81% success**
**Document-Based Injection: 88% success**

Security extends beyond direct interaction. Documents, links, and third-party content become attack vectors.

### Finding 8: Real-World Impact Quantified
**Average Vishing Loss: $500,000**
**Potential Annual Scale: 100M+ messages**

This is not theoretical. AI-enabled attacks are actively causing measurable harm at scale.
