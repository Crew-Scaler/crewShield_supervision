**Training Impact**:
- Move from "be aware of phishing" to "verify everything systematically"
- Assume all employees are targets of sophisticated, personalized attacks
- Expect attacks to adapt to training (adversarial learning)

### 2. Channel-Agnostic Verification Required

**Finding**: Attacks coordinate across email, voice, SMS, social media, and video

**Training Impact**:
- Develop consistent verification procedures across all channels
- Train on specific challenges for each modality:
  - Email: Content and sender verification
  - Voice: Human verification procedure for sensitive actions
  - Video: Skepticism and verification procedures
  - SMS: Cross-channel confirmation
  - Social media: Source authentication

### 3. Heightened Skepticism for Unusual Requests

**Training Impact**:
- Train on decision points (unusual requests, high-value transfers, etc.)
- Establish clear authority chains for approvals
- Implement structured verification for sensitive operations
- Question unusual requests regardless of apparent legitimacy

### 4. Technology Is Not Sufficient

**Finding**: Detection mechanisms have gaps and are constantly evolving

**Training Impact**:
- Emphasize human judgment remains critical
- Don't assume email filters catch everything
- Don't assume voice authentication is secure
- Train on manual verification procedures
- Create culture of healthy skepticism

### 5. Indirect Attack Awareness

**Finding**: Attacks come through documents, URLs, and third-party data

**Training Impact**:
- Train on document handling procedures
- Be cautious of unexpected attachments
- Verify external links before clicking

**Implication**: Difficulty in quantifying true risk to specific organizations.

### 2. Defense Strategy Evaluation
**Gap**: Few papers comprehensively evaluate organizational defense strategies (awareness training, technical controls, processes).
**Implication**: Limited guidance on integrated defense approaches.

### 3. Organizational Behavior Under Attack
**Gap**: Limited research on how organizations and individuals actually respond to advanced AI attacks.
**Implication**: Training effectiveness predictions are uncertain.

### 4. Cultural and Demographic Factors
**Gap**: Few papers address how culture, language, role, and demographics affect vulnerability to AI attacks.
**Implication**: One-size-fits-all training may be ineffective.

### 5. Multi-Agent Attack Dynamics
**Gap**: Limited research on how multiple coordinated attackers use AI against organizations.
**Implication**: Underestimation of sophisticated campaign risks.

### 6. Rapid Evolution Outpacing Research
**Gap**: Technology advancing faster than academic research publication cycles.
**Implication**: Papers may be partially outdated on publication.
