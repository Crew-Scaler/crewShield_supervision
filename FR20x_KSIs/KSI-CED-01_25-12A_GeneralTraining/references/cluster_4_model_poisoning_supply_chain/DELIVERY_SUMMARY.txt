KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

CRITICAL THREATS IDENTIFIED:

1. Sleeper Agents (arXiv 2401.05566) - LANDMARK PAPER
   - Deceptive backdoors persist through safety training
   - Largest models exhibit strongest persistence
   - Standard safety techniques fail to remove backdoors
   - Relevance: 10/10

2. Fine-tuning Attack Vectors (arXiv 2501.17433, 2409.18169)
   - Safety guardrails bypassable with <100 malicious samples
   - Fine-tuning APIs exploitable for training on harmful data
   - Multiple documented attack methods
   - Relevance: 9/10 each

3. Supply Chain Backdoors (arXiv 2510.05159)
   - AI agent supply chain vulnerable to multiple attack types
   - Prompt injection jailbreaks, environmental exploits
   - Statistical perturbations evade traditional detection
   - Relevance: 9/10

4. Diffusion Model Poisoning (arXiv 2508.01605)
   - >90% attack success rate with only 10 carefully chosen samples
   - Minimal poisoning ratio makes detection difficult
   - Applicable to text-to-image and graph generation models
   - Relevance: 9/10

QUANTITATIVE METRICS:

Attack Success Rates:
- MoE Architecture (BadPatches): 100% with 2% poisoning ratio
- Vision-Language Models (BadSem): 98% success
- Diffusion Models: >90% with minimal samples
- Federated Learning (PoisonedFL): High success across multiple scenarios

Detection Capability:
- Semantic Drift Analysis: 92.5% accuracy, 100% precision, 85% recall
- Trajectory Anomaly Detection (Federated): 94.3% with <1.2% FPR
- Standard pattern-based detection: Insufficient for invisible triggers

Research Gaps:
- Detection methods not evaluated on enterprise-scale models
- Limited supply chain attack attribution research
- Backdoor persistence through fine-tuning understudied
- No formal AI artifact distribution risk models

   - Low sample requirements (90% at 10 samples)
   - Papers: BadGraph (2510.20792), Text-to-Image (2508.01605)
   - Risk Level: HIGH

4. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLM)

   - Risk Level: HIGH

================================================================================
COMPLIANCE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

FOR MANDATORY SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING:

Model Validation:
- Pre-deployment verification for known backdoor patterns
- Semantic drift analysis for deceptive behavior
- Test dataset verification against poisoning signatures

Fine-tuning Controls:
- Restrict fine-tuning capabilities for critical models
- Monitor training data quality and diversity
- Implement adversarial fine-tuning tests

Supply Chain Security:
- Verify model artifact provenance and integrity
- Audit pre-trained model usage from external sources
- Maintain model integrity logs for compliance

Threat Monitoring:
- Regular scanning for invisible trigger patterns
- Semantic consistency monitoring of outputs
- Participant validation for federated learning
