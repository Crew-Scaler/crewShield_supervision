- Score 8 (High): 7 papers
- Score 7 (Medium): 3 papers
- Score 6 (Supporting): 1 paper

CRITICAL PAPERS (Highest CSP Impact):
1. 2512.19997v1.pdf - BacAlarm: API Security & BOLA Prevention
2. 2512.10361v2.pdf - Co-Location Attacks in Serverless
3. 2512.09957v1.pdf - CloudFix: IAM Policy Repair (AWS/Azure/GCP)
4. 2511.01910v2.pdf - Network Hardware Security (Cloud Infrastructure)

KEY METRICS & FINDINGS:
- Average relevance score: 8.0/10
- 93% papers from 2025 (recent)
- Focus on practical attack vectors and remediation
- Cross-CSP analysis (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

CSP IMPLICATIONS:
- BOLA attacks on cloud APIs are most critical
- Multi-tenant isolation in serverless is fundamentally vulnerable
- Vector databases lack robust security patterns
- RAG integration creates new attack surface
- IAM policy misconfiguration affects all CSPs

TRAINING USE CASES:
✓ Cloud architects (infrastructure risks)
✓ API developers (secure design patterns)
✓ ML engineers (LLM security)
✓ Security teams (threat modeling)
✓ DevOps/SRE (IAM and hardening)

FILES INCLUDED:
- 15 research papers (PDFs)
- cluster_6_metadata.csv (detailed paper metadata)
- README.md (comprehensive overview and analysis)
- SUMMARY.txt (this file)

RESEARCH QUALITY:
- All papers from recognized venues/archives
- Recent publications (2024-2025)
- Mix of academic research and industry security
- Practical attack demonstrations included
- Remediation strategies provided

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
- Some papers lack quantitative metrics
- Limited cross-CSP comparative analysis
- Few production environment validations
- Emerging threats (vector DB, RAG) still being researched

NEXT STEPS:
1. Integrate papers into training modules
2. Extract key metrics and case studies
3. Cross-reference with other clusters
4. Develop remediation playbooks based on findings
5. Update with new papers quarterly
