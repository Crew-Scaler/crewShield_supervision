PUBLICATION TIMELINE
====================

2025 (8 papers):  58% of collection - MOST CURRENT RESEARCH
2024 (7 papers):  37% of collection
2021-2023 (4 papers): 21% of collection - FOUNDATIONAL WORK

KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS
====================

1. TRAINING EFFECTIVENESS PARADOX
   - Well-designed: 86% click-rate reduction after 12 months
   - Poorly designed: NO significant improvement (even with 12K+ participants)
   - Critical factor: Implementation methodology > Content

2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGE METRICS
   - Continuous training: 60% phishing reporting vs. 7% with quarterly
   - Gamification: 40% score improvement across difficulty levels
   - AI dynamic adjustment: 72% reduction in phishing susceptibility

3. EMPLOYEE PREFERENCES
   - SHORT, scenario-based training (videos, simulations)
   - Department-specific approach outperforms generic training
   - Frequent reinforcement (monthly) beats annual compliance

4. LLM DUAL-USE FINDINGS
   - AI-generated training effective for scaling (straightforward prompts work)
   - AI-generated phishing: 54% success rate (matches human experts)
   - Both training and detection can leverage LLMs effectively

5. ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE CRITICAL
   - Top management support = prerequisite for success
   - Awareness alone ≠ behavioral change (need accountability)
   - Leadership tone shapes organizational security behavior

6. MEASUREMENT & ROI
   - Phishing click rates, reporting rates, repeat offenders
   - Breach lifecycle reduction: ~60 days
   - ROI: 3-7x investment (some organizations: 300%)

CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR CSP IMPLEMENTATION
========================================

1. Design training for SHORT, SCENARIO-BASED delivery
   - Not annual compliance theater
   - Monthly reinforcement beats quarterly

2. Tailor to department-specific threats
   - HR: malware, executive impersonation
   - Accounting: invoice fraud, credential theft, ransomware
   - Sales: social engineering, credential harvesting

3. Secure executive sponsorship FIRST
   - Top management support is prerequisite
   - Visible leadership commitment shapes culture

4. Measure with quantitative metrics
   - Track: click rates, reporting rates, time-to-report
   - Calculate: ROI, breach lifecycle reduction
   - Assess: organizational culture maturity

5. Complement with technical controls
   - Training alone insufficient
   - Use email filtering, MFA, zero-trust architecture
   - Defense in depth approach essential

6. Leverage AI for scaling, not replacing humans
   - LLM-generated training effective for personalization
   - Still need human oversight, culture building
   - Monitor for AI-generated threat evolution
