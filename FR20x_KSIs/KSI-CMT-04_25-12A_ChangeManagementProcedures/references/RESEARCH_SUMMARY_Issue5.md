## Validation of 15-Minute Review SLA Feasibility

### Evidence Supporting Rapid Emergency Response

**Industry Practices (2024-2025):**
- **Critical incident response: 15 minutes** (multiple cybersecurity firms)
- **Splunk: 7-minute mean time to detect phishing attacks** (2024 metrics)
- **High-priority tickets: 4 business hours resolution** (IT support vendors)

**Regulatory Frameworks:**
- GDPR: 72-hour breach notification requirement
- HIPAA: Detailed breach documentation and reporting

**ECAB Best Practices:**
- **ECAB size: 3-7 members** (vs. larger CAB)
- **On-demand convening** vs. scheduled CAB meetings
- **Automation-enhanced approval workflows** (minutes for ticket creation and approval)
- **Post-implementation review within 24 hours**

**Technical Capabilities:**
- **Jenkins CI/CD: 15-minute polling intervals** (proven in LLM test generation)
- **Automated notifications via email** for emergency approvals
- **Real-time monitoring and alert systems**

### Framework for 15-Minute eCAB Review

**Composition:**
1. CISO or designee
2. VP of Operations or on-call engineer
3. Subject Matter Expert (rotation)

**Process Flow:**
1. **T+0 min:** Emergency RFC auto-created (abbreviated template)
2. **T+3 min:** Automated notification to eCAB members
3. **T+5 min:** Initial risk assessment (automated + human validation)
4. **T+10 min:** eCAB deliberation (focus: urgency, risk, rollback plan)
5. **T+15 min:** Approval decision with documented justification
6. **T+60 min:** Implementation begins (if approved)
7. **T+24 hours:** Post-implementation review scheduled

**Enablers:**
- Pre-approved emergency patterns (security patches, model rollback, data isolation)
- Automated risk scoring (ML-based assessment)
- Templated justification frameworks
- Real-time collaboration tools (Slack, Teams integration)
- Immutable audit trail capture
