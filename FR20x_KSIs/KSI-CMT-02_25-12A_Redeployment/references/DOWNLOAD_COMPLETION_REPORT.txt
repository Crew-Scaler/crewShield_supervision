KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS VALIDATED:
================================================================================

✅ THREAT VALIDATION:
   - Baseline poisoning is real and actively exploited
   - "Session creep" documented in multiple 2024-2025 papers
   - APTs employ gradual baseline manipulation
   - AI-powered monitoring systems are vulnerable

✅ DETECTION EFFECTIVENESS:
   - 94.3% insider threat detection accuracy achievable
   - <1.2% false positive rates with behavioral analytics
   - XAI (SHAP/LIME) enables audit-ready attribution
   - Multi-temporal baselines detect gradual poisoning

✅ DEFENSE FEASIBILITY:
   - Adversarial training: +35% accuracy under attack
   - GAN-based defense: +10-15% F1-score improvement
   - Immutable infrastructure blocks unauthorized drift
   - Version-controlled baselines prevent poisoning

✅ AI AGENT RISKS:
   - Autonomous agents require specialized governance
   - Provenance tracking and audit trails essential
   - Runtime containment prevents lateral movement
   - Agent policy drift enables privilege escalation

RESEARCH IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
================================================================================

This research collection provides:

✅ Validation: Confirms baseline poisoning and insider threat risks from survey
✅ Evidence: 48 peer-reviewed papers with empirical validation
✅ Guidance: Specific implementation recommendations for CSP infrastructure
✅ Metrics: Quantified detection accuracy, false positive rates, defense improvements
✅ Roadmap: Clear progression from quick wins to long-term strategic initiatives

The research demonstrates that with proper instrumentation (multi-temporal 
baselines, XAI attribution, immutable infrastructure, adversarial training), 
CSPs can detect baseline poisoning attacks and attribute insider threats with 
high accuracy while distinguishing legitimate drift from malicious manipulation.
