# Extracted Metadata and Statistics

**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets
**Status:** 30 core questions retained (KSI-CNA-06-Q01 through KSI-CNA-06-Q30); 10 questions moved to other KSIs for scope alignment

**Filtering Criteria:** Questions directly addressing high availability for AI-powered workloads with focus on technical architecture and recovery mechanisms. Removed: compliance governance (Q32-34), financial/business impact analysis (Q35-36), generic observability tooling (Q37-38), incident process management (Q39-40), and agent access control (Q12). Core focus: AI-specific failure modes (reasoning drift, memory poisoning, cascade failures), KV cache durability and state management, multi-agent coordination and Byzantine fault tolerance, distributed observability for semantic health (beyond traditional APM), chaos engineering validation, durable execution frameworks for long-running tasks, multi-region consistency and replication, disaster recovery with AI workload considerations.

**Research Basis:** 434 papers synthesized into 10 thematic clusters emphasizing: AI-specific failure modes (44 papers), KV cache state management (45 papers), multi-agent orchestration (40 papers), distributed observability (50 papers), chaos engineering (45 papers), durable execution (45 papers), multi-region consistency (250 papers), data consistency architecture (80 papers), disaster recovery (35 papers), CSP architecture evolution (60 papers). Key findings validated: AnchorTP achieves <1s RTO with zero RPO, 59% faster time-to-peak; KV cache corruption from single bit-flip can hijack outputs; semantic monitoring detects failures 30-45 minutes before traditional APM; Byzantine fault tolerance requires 3-4x replication; network partitions cause split-brain if not properly handled; 99.999% uptime achievable with AI-native HA patterns.

**Changes from v1.0:**
- Renumbered all questions to sequential format: KSI-CNA-06-Q01 through KSI-CNA-06-Q30 (consolidated from original Q1-Q40 with removed items)
- Removed: Q12 (agent delegation security) → KSI-IAM-05 (Least Privilege)
- Removed: Q32-Q34 (compliance governance) → Compliance Automation / Policy-as-Code KSI
- Removed: Q35-Q36 (financial impact) → Business/Financial Impact KSI
- Removed: Q37-Q38 (observability tools/retention) → Logging/Observability KSI
- Removed: Q39-Q40 (incident processes) → Incident Response/Learning KSI
- Added explicit "Moved to Other KSIs" section for traceability
- Sections preserved: 8 core sections (AI-Specific Failure Modes, KV Cache State Management, Multi-Agent Orchestration, Distributed Observability, Chaos Engineering, Durable Execution, Multi-Region Consistency, Disaster Recovery)
