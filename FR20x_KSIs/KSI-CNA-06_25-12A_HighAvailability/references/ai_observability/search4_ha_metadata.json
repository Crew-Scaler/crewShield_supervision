    "summary": "In the era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, its applications span across diverse fields, relying heavily on effective data processing and model optimization. Combined Regularized Support Vector Machines (CR-SVMs) can effectively handle the structural information among data features, but there is a lack of efficient algorithms in distributed-stored big data. To address this issue, w...",

One reason is that model output probabilities are often not well-correlated with correctness, and reflect only the final output of the generation process. Inspired by findings that LLMs internally encode concepts like truthfulness, this paper explores if LLMs similarly represent code co...",
