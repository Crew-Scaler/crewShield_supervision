    "summary": "When a network is attacked, cyber defenders need to precisely identify which systems (i.e., computers or devices) were compromised and what damage may have been inflicted. This process is sometimes referred to as cyber triage and is an important part of the incident response procedure. Cyber triage is challenging because the impacts of a network breach can be far-reaching with unpredictable conseq...",
