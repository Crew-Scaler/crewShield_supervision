  "summary": "The field of AI Control seeks to develop robust control protocols, deployment safeguards for untrusted AI which may be intentionally subversive. However, existing protocols that rely on weaker monitors to detect unsafe behavior often fail on complex tasks beyond the monitor's comprehension. We develop control protocols based on factored cognition, in which a trusted model decomposes a task, an unt"
