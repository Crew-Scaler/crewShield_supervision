  "summary": "Sound Event Detection (SED) systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications such as industrial monitoring and audio surveillance. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks has not been well explored. Existing audio adversarial attacks targeting SED systems, which incorporate both detection and localization capabilities, often lack effectiveness due to SED's strong contextual dependencies or lack precision by focusing solely on misclassifying the target region as the..."
