  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate code with minimal human oversight, raising critical concerns about backdoor injection and malicious behavior. We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the"
