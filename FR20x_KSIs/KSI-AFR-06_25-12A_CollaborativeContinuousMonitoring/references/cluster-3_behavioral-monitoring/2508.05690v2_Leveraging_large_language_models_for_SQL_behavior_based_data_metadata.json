  "summary": "Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granula..."
