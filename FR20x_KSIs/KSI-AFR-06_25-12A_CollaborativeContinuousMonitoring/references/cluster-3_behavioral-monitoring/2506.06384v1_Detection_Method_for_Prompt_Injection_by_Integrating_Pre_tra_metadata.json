  "summary": "With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion detection framework. It integrates a pretrained langu..."
