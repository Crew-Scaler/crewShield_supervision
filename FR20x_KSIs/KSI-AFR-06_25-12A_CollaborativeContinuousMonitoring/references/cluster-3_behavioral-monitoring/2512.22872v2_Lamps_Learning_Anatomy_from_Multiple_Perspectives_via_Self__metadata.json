  "summary": "Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting ..."
