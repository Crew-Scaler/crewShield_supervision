  "summary": "Bee populations are declining globally due to habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change, threatening agricultural productivity and food security. While existing smart beehive systems monitor internal conditions, they typically overlook external environmental factors that significantly influence colony health, and are constrained by high cost, limited scalability, and inadequate contextual analysis. We present WaggleNet, a novel dual-scope monitoring system that simultaneously captures..."
