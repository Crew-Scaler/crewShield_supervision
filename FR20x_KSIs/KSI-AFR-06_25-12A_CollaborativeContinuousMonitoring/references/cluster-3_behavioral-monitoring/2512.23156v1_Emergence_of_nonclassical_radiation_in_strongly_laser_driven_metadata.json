  "summary": "Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and gen..."
