  "summary": "Omnia presents a synthetic data driven pipeline to accelerate the training, validation, and deployment readiness of militarized humanoids. The approach converts first-person spatial observations captured from point-of-view recordings, smart glasses, augmented reality headsets, and spatial browsing workflows into scalable, mission-specific synthetic datasets for humanoid autonomy. By generating large volumes of high-fidelity simulated scenarios and pairing them with automated labeling and model t..."
