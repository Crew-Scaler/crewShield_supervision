  "summary": "Classical array processing methods such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) provide statistically grounded solutions for signal detection and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, but their high computational cost limits their use in low-latency settings. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, D"
