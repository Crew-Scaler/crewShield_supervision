  "summary": "The progress and integration of intelligent transport systems (ITS) have therefore been central to creating safer and more efficient transport networks. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has the potential to improve road safety and provide comfort to travelers. However, this technology is exposed to a variety of security vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. One of the most serious threats to IoV is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which could be used to disrupt traff..."
