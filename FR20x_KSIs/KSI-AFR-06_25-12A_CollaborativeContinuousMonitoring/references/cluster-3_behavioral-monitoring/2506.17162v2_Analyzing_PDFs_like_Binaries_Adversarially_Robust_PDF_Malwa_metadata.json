  "summary": "Malicious PDF files have emerged as a persistent threat and become a popular attack vector in web-based attacks. While machine learning-based PDF malware classifiers have shown promise, these classifiers are often susceptible to adversarial attacks, undermining their reliability. To address this issue, recent studies have aimed to enhance the robustness of PDF classifiers. Despite these efforts, the feature engineering underlying these studies remains outdated. Consequently, even with the applic..."
