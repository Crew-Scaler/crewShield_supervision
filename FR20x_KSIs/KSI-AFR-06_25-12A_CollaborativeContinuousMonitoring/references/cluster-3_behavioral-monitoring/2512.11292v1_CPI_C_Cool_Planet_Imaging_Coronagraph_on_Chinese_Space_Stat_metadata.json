  "summary": "Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is proposed to direct image the cool planets around nearby solar-type stars (within 40 pc). The core scientific objective of CPI-C is to conduct high-contrast directly imaging surveys of exoplanets ranging in size from Neptune-like to Jupiter-like, located at separations of 0.5 to 5 AU from their host stars, and to perform systematic spectroscopic analysis of the detected planets through high-precision multi..."
