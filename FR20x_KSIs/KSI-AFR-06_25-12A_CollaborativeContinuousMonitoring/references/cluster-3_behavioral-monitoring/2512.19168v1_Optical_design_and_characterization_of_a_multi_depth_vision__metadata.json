  "summary": "We present a vision simulator device (Katsim), a compact near-eye optical display designed for assessing postoperative corrected vision, preoperative intraocular lens (IOL) assessment, and objective IOL characterization. The system forms a virtual image using an amplitude-modulated LCoS spatial light modulator (AM-SLM), RGB LED illumination, and a high-speed varifocal lens. In the proposed architecture, the LED illumination and varifocal lens diopter changes are triggered in synchrony with the S..."
