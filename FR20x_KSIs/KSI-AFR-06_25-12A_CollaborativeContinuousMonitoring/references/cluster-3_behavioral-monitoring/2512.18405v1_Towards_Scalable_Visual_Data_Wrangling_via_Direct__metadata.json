  "summary": "Data wrangling - the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis - is a well-known bottleneck in data science workflows. Existing tools either rely on manual scripting, which is error-prone and hard to debug, or automate cleaning through opaque black-box pipelines that offer limited control. We present Buckaroo, a scalable visual data wrangling system that restructures data "
