  "summary": "Context: Dynamic production environments make it challenging to maintain reliable machine learning (ML) systems. Runtime issues, such as changes in data patterns or operating contexts, that degrade model performance are a common occurrence in production settings. Monitoring enables early detection and mitigation of these runtime issues, helping maintain users' trust and prevent unwanted consequences for organizations. Aim: This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ML monitoring ..."
