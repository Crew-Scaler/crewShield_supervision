  "summary": "We investigate real-time tracking of two correlated stochastic processes over a shared wireless channel. The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its cor..."
