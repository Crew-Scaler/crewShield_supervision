  "summary": "The rapid evolution of network infrastructure is bringing new challenges and opportunities for efficient network management, optimization, and security. With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network monitoring management by addressing the limitations of query finding and pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to e..."
