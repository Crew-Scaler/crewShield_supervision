  "summary": "The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image, without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial and vocal features, FOICE "
