  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller, domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to internal signals such as logits, wh"
