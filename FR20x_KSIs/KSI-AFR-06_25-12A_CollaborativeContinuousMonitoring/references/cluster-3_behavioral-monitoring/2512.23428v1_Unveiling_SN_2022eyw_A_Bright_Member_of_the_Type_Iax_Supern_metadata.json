  "summary": "We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of Supernova (SN) 2022eyw, a luminous member of the Type Iax SN subclass. SN 2022eyw reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g = -17.80\\pm0.15$ mag and exhibited a rise time of $\\sim$15 days, placing it among the brighter Iax events. The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\\pm0.003~\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\\pm0.09~\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\\tim..."
