  "summary": "FRB 20240114A is extraordinarily active, and therefore presents an opportunity to search for the periodicity predicted by magnetar models of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB). Zhang, et al. (2025) observed 11,553 bursts, including 3196 on MJD 60381 (March 12, 2024). We find no significant peak in the periodogram of those bursts, which occur within 15628 s, short enough that even with a characteristic slowing age of 1 year a signal with period $\\ge 0.1\\,$s it would not significantly dephase within the obse..."
