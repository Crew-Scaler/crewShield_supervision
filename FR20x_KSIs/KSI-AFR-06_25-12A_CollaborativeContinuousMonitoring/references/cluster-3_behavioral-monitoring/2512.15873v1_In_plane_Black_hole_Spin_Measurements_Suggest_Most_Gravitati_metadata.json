  "summary": "The spin-orbit tilt angles $\u03b8_{1(2)}$ of merging stellar-mass black holes provide key insights into their astrophysical origin. The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA Collaborations (2025a, arXiv:2508.18083) report that the spin-orbit tilt distribution of mergers in the latest Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 exhibits a global peak at near-perpendicular directions $\\cos\u03b8_{1(2)}\\approx0$. Here, we recover this feature using hierarchical Bayesian inference with parametric models that are tailored to e..."
