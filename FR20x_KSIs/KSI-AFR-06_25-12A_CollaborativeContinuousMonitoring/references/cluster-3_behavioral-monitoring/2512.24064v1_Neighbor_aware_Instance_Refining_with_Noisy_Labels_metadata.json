  "summary": "In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have be"
