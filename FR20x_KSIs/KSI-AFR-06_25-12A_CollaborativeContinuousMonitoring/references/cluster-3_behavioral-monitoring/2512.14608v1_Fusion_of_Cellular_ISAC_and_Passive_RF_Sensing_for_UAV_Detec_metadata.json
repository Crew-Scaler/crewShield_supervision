  "summary": "The rapid growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civilian and critical-infrastructure airspace has created a need for reliable detection and tracking systems that operate under diverse environmental and sensing conditions. This paper presents a UAV detection and tracking system that fuses measurements from a network of passive Keysight N6841A RF sensors and a Ku-band Fortem TrueView R20 radar operating in the FR3 spectrum (16.3 GHz) as an ISAC proxy. Real-world experiments at the NSF AERPA..."
