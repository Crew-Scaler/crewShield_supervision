  "summary": "We report the discovery of variable $\u03b3$-rays up to petaelectronvolt from Cygnus X-3, an iconic X-ray binary. The $\u03b3$-ray signal was detected with a statistical significance of approximately 10 $\u03c3$ by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Its intrinsic spectral energy distribution (SED), extending from 0.06 to 3.7 PeV, shows a pronounced rise toward 1 PeV after accounting for abs"
