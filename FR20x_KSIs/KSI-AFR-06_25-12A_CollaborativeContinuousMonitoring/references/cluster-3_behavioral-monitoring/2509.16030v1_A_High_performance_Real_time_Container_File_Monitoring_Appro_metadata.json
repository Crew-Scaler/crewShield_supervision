  "summary": "As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually based on host operating system or v..."
