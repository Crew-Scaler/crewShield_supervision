  "summary": "Objective\n  Interaction vertex imaging (IVI) is used for range monitoring in carbon ion radiotherapy, detecting depth differences between Bragg peak positions. Online range monitoring, which provides feedback during beam delivery, is particularly desirable, creating an opportunity to detect range errors before the treatment fraction is completed. Incorporating online range monitoring into clinical workflows may therefore improve the safety and consistency of radiotherapy.\n  Approach\n  The data a..."
