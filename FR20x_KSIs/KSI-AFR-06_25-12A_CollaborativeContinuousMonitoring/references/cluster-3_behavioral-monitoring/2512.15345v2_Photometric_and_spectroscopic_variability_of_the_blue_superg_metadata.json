  "summary": "Context. The post-main-sequence evolution of massive stars remains poorly understood, particularly for blue supergiants. These objects play a crucial role in the dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies and exhibit pronounced photometric and spectroscopic variability, often quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic.\n  Aims. We investigate the variability of the evolved B-type star rho Leo to determine its physical properties, identify the underlying mechanisms driving its variability, and..."
