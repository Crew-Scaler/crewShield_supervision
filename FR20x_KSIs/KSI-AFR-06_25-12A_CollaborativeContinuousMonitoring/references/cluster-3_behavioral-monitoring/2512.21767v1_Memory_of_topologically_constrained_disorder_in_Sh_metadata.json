  "summary": "Complex behaviors often sit at a critical threshold between order and disorder. But not all disorder is created equal. Disorder can be trivial or constrained, and correlated disorder can even be topological. Crucially, constrained disorder can harbor memory, leading to non-trivial, sequence-dependent responses to external manipulations. And yet the fascinating subject of \"memory of disorder\" remai"
