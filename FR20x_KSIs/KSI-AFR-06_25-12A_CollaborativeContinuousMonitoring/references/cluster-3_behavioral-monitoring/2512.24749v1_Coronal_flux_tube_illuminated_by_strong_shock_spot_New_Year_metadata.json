  "summary": "Powerful solar eruptions are known to produce fast and wide shock waves in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. The relationship between the coronal shock waves, solar energetic particles and different types of radio emission is a subject of long-lasting research activity. In this work, we perform a case study of 31 December 2023 eruption that occurred near eastern limb of the Sun. It produced a X5.0 class X-ray flare, a global EUV wave, a fast $\\sim3000$ km/s Coronal Mass Ejection, strong ra..."
