  "summary": "Wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), supported by recent advancements in wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, hold significant potential for extending network lifetime. However, traditional approaches often prioritize scheduling algorithms and network optimization, overlooking the security risks associated with the charging process, which exposes the network to potential attacks. This paper addresses this gap by integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Digital Twin techno..."
