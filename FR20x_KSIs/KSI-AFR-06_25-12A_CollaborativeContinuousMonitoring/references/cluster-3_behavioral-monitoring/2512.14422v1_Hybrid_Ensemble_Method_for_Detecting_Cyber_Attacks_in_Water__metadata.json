  "summary": "The cybersecurity of Industrial Control Systems that manage critical infrastructure such as Water Distribution Systems has become increasingly important as digital connectivity expands. BATADAL benchmark data is a good source of testing intrusion detection techniques, but it presents several important problems, such as imbalance in the number of classes, multivariate time dependence, and stealthy attacks. We consider a hybrid ensemble learning model that will enhance the detection ability of cyb..."
