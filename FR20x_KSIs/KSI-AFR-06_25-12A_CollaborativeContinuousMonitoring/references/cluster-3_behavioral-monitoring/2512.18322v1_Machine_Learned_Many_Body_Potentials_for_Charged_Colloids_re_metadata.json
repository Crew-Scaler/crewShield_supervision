  "summary": "Past experimental observations of gas-liquid and gas-crystal coexistence in low-salinity suspensions of highly charged colloids have suggested the existence of like charge attraction. Evidence for this phenomenon was also observed in primitive-model simulations of (asymmetric) electrolytes and of low-charge nanoparticle dispersions. These results from low-valency simulations have often been extrapolated to experimental parameter regimes of high colloid valency where like-charge attraction betwee..."
