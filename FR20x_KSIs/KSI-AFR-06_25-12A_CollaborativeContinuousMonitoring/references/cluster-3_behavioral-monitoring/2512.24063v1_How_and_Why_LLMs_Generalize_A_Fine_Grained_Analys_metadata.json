  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning i"
