  "summary": "Molecules harbouring sulfur are thought to have played a key role in the biological processes of life on Earth. We report the first astronomical detection of a sulfur-bearing cyclic 1hydrocarbon in interstellar space. Observations of the Galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 reveal the presence of 2,5-cyclohexadien-1-thione - a structural isomer of thiophenol ($c$-C$_6$H$_6$S). To allow the astronomical identification, we first performed precise laboratory measurements of the thiophenol ..."
