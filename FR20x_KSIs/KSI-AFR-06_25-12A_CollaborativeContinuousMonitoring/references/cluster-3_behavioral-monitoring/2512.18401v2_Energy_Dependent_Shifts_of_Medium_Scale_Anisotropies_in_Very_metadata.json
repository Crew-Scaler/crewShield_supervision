  "summary": "Small deviations from isotropy in the arrival directions of Galactic cosmic rays serve as a unique probe of the local magnetic environment. In this Letter, we report observations of medium-scale anisotropies (MSA) at energies above 10 TeV using the LHAASO-KM2A array. Our analysis identifies four regions of excess and four regions of deficit, each spanning angular scales of approximately ten degrees. Crucially, we detect significant energy-dependent shifts in the centroids of two excess regions: ..."
