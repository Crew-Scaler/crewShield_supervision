  "summary": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to highly diverse and interconnected ecosystems that are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. Conventional anomaly detection schemes often prioritize accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency and environmental impact, which limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. This paper presents \\textit{EcoDefender}, a sustainable hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates \\textit{..."
