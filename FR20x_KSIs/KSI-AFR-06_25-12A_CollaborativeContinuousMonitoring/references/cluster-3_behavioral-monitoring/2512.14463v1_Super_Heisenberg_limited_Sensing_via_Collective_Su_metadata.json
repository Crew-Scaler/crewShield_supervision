  "summary": "We explore the quantum-metrological potential of subwavelength-spaced emitter arrays coupled to a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide. In this system, strong dipole--dipole interactions profoundly modify the collective optical response, leading to the emergence of ultranarrow subradiant resonances. Through an eigenmode analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a universal s"
