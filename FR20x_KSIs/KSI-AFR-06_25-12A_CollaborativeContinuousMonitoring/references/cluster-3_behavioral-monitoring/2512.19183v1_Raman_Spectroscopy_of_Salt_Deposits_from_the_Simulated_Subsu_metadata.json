  "summary": "Saturn's ice-covered moon Enceladus may host a subsurface ocean with biologically relevant chemistry. Plumes released from this ocean preserve information on its chemical state, and previous analyses suggest weakly to strongly alkaline pH (approximately pH 8--12). Constraining the pH requires identification of pH-sensitive minerals in plume deposits. Several analytical techniques could provide such mineralogical information, but few are practical for deployment on planetary missions. Raman spect..."
