  "summary": "We present a systematic numerical investigation of bifurcations in the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes flow past a confined circular cylinder. The results indicate that there is a qualitative correspondence between changes in the traction profiles of the steady Navier-Stokes equations and bifurcations of the long-time behavior of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. The bifurcations include the appearance of symmetry breaking, oscillations, and multiple steady solutions. The well-k..."
