  "summary": "Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage me..."
