  "summary": "Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) has emerged as a leading quantum communication protocol, enabling secure key distribution over unprecedented distances by utilising coherent interference of quantum states. Optical Injection Locking (OIL) architectures have been used to simplify the precise phase and frequency stabilisation required by TF-QKD. In this work, we systematically analyse potential side-channels in OIL-based TF-QKD that can be introduced through the various optical degrees ..."
