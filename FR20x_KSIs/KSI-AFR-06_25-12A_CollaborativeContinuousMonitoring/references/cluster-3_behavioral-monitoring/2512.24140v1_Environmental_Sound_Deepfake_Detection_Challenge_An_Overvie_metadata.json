  "summary": "Recent progress in audio generation models has made it possible to create highly realistic and immersive soundscapes, which are now widely used in film and virtual-reality-related applications. However, these audio generators also raise concerns about potential misuse, such as producing deceptive audio for fabricated videos or spreading misleading information. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective methods for detecting fake environmental sounds. Existing datasets for environmental soun..."
