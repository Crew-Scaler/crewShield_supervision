  "summary": "This paper explores vulnerabilities in RSA cryptosystems that arise from improper prime number selection during key generation. We examine two primary attack vectors: Fermat's factorization method, which exploits RSA keys generated with primes that are too close together, and the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) attack, which exploits keys that share a common prime factor.
