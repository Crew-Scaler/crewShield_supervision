  "summary": "Recently, filter bank multi-carrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) technology has been proposed for use in ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems. It has been noted that, due to the spectral partitioning properties of the filter banks, a UWB signal can be synthesized and processed using a parallel set of signal processors operating at a moderate rate. This transceiver architecture can be used to ge"
