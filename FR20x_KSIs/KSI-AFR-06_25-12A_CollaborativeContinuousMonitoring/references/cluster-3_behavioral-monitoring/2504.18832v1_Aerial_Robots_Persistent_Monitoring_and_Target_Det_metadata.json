  "summary": "In this manuscript, we present a distributed algorithm for multi-robot persistent monitoring and target detection. In particular, we propose a novel solution that effectively integrates the Time-inverted Kuramoto model, three-dimensional Lissajous curves, and Model Predictive Control. We focus on the implementation of this algorithm on aerial robots, addressing the practical challenges involved in"
