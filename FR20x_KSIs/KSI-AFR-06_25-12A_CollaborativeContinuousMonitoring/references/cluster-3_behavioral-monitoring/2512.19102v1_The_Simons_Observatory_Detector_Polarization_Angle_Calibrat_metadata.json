  "summary": "Improved measurements of $B$-modes in the cosmic microwave background can be obtained through accurate calibration of the orientation of detector antennas as projected onto the sky. Miscalibration of the detector polarization angle leads to a leakage of $E$-modes into $B$-modes, which can bias the detection of the latter. To achieve a $\u03c3(r)$ of 0.003, the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes are required to calibrate the global polarization angle on the sky with an accuracy ${\\lesssim}0...."
