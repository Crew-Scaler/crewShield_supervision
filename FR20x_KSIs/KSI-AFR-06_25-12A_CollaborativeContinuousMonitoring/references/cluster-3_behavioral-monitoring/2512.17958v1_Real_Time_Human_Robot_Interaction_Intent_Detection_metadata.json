  "summary": "Service robots in public spaces require real-time understanding of human behavioral intentions for natural interaction. We present a practical multimodal framework for frame-accurate human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses camera-invariant 2D skeletal pose and facial emotion features extracted from monocular RGB video. Unlike prior methods requiring RGB-D sensors or GPU acceleration, o"
