  "summary": "We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art (SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods that require impractical, continuous labeling ..."
