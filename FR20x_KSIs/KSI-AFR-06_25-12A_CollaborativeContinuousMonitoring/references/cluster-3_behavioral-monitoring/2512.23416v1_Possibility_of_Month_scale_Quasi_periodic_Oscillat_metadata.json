  "summary": "In this work, we report evidence suggesting the potential future detection of a month-scale quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the gamma-ray light curve of OP 313. We analysed almost 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data and applied the Bayesian block method to the monthly-binned light curve. We identified four high-flux states and investigated the possibility of a QPO in the fourth high-flux st"
