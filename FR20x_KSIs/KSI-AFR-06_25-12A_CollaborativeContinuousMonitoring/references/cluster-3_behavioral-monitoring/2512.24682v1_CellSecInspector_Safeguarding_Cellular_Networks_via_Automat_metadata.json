  "summary": "The complexity, interdependence, and rapid evolution of 3GPP specifications present fundamental challenges for ensuring the security of modern cellular networks. Manual reviews and existing automated approaches, which often depend on rule-based parsing or small sets of manually crafted security requirements, fail to capture deep semantic dependencies, cross-sentence/clause relationships, and evolving specification behaviors. In this work, we present CellSecInspector, an automated framework for s..."
