  "summary": "A Digital Twin (DT) framework to enhance carbon-based gas plume monitoring is critical for supporting timely and effective mitigation responses to environmental hazards such as industrial gas leaks, or wildfire outbreaks carrying large carbon emissions. We present AIMNET, a one-of-a-kind DT framework that integrates a built-in-house Internet of Things (IoT)-based continuous sensing network with a "
