  "summary": "Autonomous Flying Networks (FNs) are emerging as a key enabler of on-demand connectivity in dynamic and infrastructure-limited environments. However, current approaches mainly focus on UAV placement, routing, and resource management, neglecting the autonomous perception of users and their service demands - a critical capability for zero-touch network operation.\n  This paper presents the Multi-Agen"
