  "summary": "Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential for securing networks by identifying and mitigating unauthorized activities indicative of cyberattacks. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, NIDS must evolve to detect both emerging threats and deviations from normal behavior. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) methods to improve the NIDS accuracy throu"
