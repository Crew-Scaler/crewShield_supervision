  "summary": "The deep integration of quantum communication and fiber-optic sensing is pivotal for the development of next-generation multifunctional and highly reliable secure information infrastructure. Here, we present a Sagnac-loop integrated system (SLIS) that, for the first time, combines ring-based quantum key distribution (QKD) with fiber-based weak measurement (WM) enhanced sensing and disturbance loca"
