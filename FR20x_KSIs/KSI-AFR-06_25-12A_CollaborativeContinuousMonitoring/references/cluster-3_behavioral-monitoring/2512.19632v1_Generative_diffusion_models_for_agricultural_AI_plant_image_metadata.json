  "summary": "The success of agricultural artificial intelligence depends heavily on large, diverse, and high-quality plant image datasets, yet collecting such data in real field conditions is costly, labor intensive, and seasonally constrained. This paper investigates diffusion-based generative modeling to address these challenges through plant image synthesis, indoor-to-outdoor translation, and expert preference aligned fine tuning. First, a Stable Diffusion model is fine tuned on captioned indoor and outdo..."
