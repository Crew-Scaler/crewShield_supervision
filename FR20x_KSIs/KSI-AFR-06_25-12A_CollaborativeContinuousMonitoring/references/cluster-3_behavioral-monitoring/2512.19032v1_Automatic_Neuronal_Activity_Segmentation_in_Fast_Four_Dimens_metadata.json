  "summary": "Fluorescence Microcopy Calcium Imaging is a fundamental tool to in-vivo record and analyze large scale neuronal activities simultaneously at a single cell resolution. Automatic and precise detection of behaviorally relevant neuron activity from the recordings is critical to study the mapping of brain activity in organisms. However a perpetual bottleneck to this problem is the manual segmentation which is time and labor intensive and lacks generalizability. To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep..."
