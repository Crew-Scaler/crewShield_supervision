  "summary": "Increasing autonomous vehicles (AVs) in transportation systems makes effective interactions between AVs and pedestrians indispensable. External human--machine interface (eHMI), which employs visual or auditory cues to explicitly convey vehicle behaviors can compensate for the loss of human-like interactions and enhance AV--pedestrian cooperation. To facilitate faster intent convergence between pedestrian and AVs, this study incorporates an adaptive interaction mechanism into eHMI based on pedest..."
