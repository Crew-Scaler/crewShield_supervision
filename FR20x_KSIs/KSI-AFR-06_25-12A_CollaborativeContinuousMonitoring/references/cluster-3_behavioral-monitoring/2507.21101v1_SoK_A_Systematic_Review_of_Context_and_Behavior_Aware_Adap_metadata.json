  "summary": "As mobile computing becomes central to digital interaction, researchers have turned their attention to adaptive authentication for its real-time, context- and behavior-aware verification capabilities. However, many implementations remain fragmented, inconsistently apply intelligent techniques, and fall short of user expectations. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we analyze 41 peer-reviewed studies since 2011 that focus on adaptive authentication in mobile environments. Our analysis sp..."
