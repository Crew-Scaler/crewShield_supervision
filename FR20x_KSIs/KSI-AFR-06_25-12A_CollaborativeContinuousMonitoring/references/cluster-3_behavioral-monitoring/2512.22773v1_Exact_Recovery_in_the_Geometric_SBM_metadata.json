  "summary": "Community detection is the problem of identifying dense communities in networks. Motivated by transitive behavior in social networks (\"thy friend is my friend\"), an emerging line of work considers spatially-embedded networks, which inherently produce graphs containing many triangles. In this paper, we consider the problem of exact label recovery in the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (GSBM), a model proposed by Baccelli and Sankararaman as the spatially-embedded analogue of the well-studied Sto..."
