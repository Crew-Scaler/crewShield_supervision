  "summary": "As embodied agents advance toward real-world deployment, ensuring optimal decisions becomes critical for resource-constrained applications. Current evaluation methods focus primarily on functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional optimality of generated plans. This gap can lead to significant performance degradation and resource waste. We identify and formalize the problem of Non-optimal Decisions (NoDs), where agents complete tasks successfully but inefficiently. We present NoD-DGMT,..."
