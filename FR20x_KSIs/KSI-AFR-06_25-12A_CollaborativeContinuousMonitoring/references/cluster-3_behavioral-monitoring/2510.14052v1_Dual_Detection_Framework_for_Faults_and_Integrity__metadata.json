  "summary": "Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the security and safety of cyber-physical control systems, and accurately distinguishing between different anomaly types is crucial for system recovery and mitigation. This study proposes a dual detection framework for anomaly detection and discrimination. By leveraging the dynamic characteristics of control loops and the stealthiness features of integrity a"
