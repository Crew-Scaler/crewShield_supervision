  "summary": "Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL), by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, dep..."
