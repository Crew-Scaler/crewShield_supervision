  "summary": "Significant digitalization of financial services in a short period of time has led to an urgent demand to have autonomous, transparent and real-time credit risk decision making systems. The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit ..."
