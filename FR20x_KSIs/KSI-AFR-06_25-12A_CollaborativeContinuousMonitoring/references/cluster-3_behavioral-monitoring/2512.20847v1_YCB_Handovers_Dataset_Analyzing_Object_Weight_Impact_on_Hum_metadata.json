  "summary": "This paper introduces the YCB-Handovers dataset, capturing motion data of 2771 human-human handovers with varying object weights. The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for roboti..."
