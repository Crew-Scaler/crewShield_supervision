  "summary": "Robust lane detection is essential for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving, yet models trained on public datasets such as CULane often fail to generalise across different camera viewpoints. This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring by introducing a generative AI-based data enhancement pipeline. The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deploy..."
