  "summary": "Low-velocity shocks from Supernova Remnants (SNRs) may set the physical and chemical conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. Recent evidence suggests that the Sun might have formed through this process. However, the chemical conditions of shock-induced star forming region remain poorly constrained. We study the chemical complexity of a shock-impacted clump, with potential to yield star f"
