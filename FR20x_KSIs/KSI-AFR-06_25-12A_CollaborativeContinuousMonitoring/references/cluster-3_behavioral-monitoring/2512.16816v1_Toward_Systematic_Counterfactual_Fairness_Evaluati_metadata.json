  "summary": "Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational components of modern software systems. As their influence grows, concerns about fairness have become increasingly pressing. Prior work has proposed metamorphic testing to detect fairness issues, applying input transformations to uncover inconsistencies in model behavior. This paper introduces an alternative perspective for testing counterfact"
