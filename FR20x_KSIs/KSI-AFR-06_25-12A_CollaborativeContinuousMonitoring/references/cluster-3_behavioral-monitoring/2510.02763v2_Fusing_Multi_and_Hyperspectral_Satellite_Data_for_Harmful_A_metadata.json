  "summary": "We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs self-supervised representation learning, hier..."
