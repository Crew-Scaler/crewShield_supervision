  "summary": "The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters. We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073, and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluste..."
