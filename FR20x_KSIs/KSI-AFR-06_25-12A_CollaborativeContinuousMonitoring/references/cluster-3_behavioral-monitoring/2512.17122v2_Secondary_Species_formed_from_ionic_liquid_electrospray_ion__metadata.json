  "summary": "The operational lifetime of ionic liquid electrospray propulsion systems is limited by plume-extractor electrode interactions. Over time, propellant accumulation, surface erosion, and electrical shorts degrade the extractor and therefore restrict the total impulse throughput. Characterizing the secondary species generated by plume impacts with deposited ionic liquid is therefore essential to understanding and mitigating these degradation pathways. A surface analysis technique known as Time-of-Fl..."
