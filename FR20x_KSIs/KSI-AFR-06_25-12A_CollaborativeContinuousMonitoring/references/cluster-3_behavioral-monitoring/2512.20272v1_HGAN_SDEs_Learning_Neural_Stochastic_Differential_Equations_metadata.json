  "summary": "Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computati..."
