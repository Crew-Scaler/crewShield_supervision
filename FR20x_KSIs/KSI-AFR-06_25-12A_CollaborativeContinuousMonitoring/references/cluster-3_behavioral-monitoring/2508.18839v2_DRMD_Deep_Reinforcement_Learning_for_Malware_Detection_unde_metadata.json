  "summary": "Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats, limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers, without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning (AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate th..."
