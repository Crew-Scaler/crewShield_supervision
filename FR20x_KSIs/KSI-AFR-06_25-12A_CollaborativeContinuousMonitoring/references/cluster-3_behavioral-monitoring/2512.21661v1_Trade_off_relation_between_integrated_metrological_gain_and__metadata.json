  "summary": "Quantum metrology plays a central role in precision sensing, where quantum enhancement of detection performance is crucial for both fundamental studies and practical applications. In this work, we derive a tight performance bound for magnetic-field sensing with a spin ensemble in the presence of dissipation. The metrological performance is quantified by the integrated metrological gain (IMG), which explicitly incorporates the time evolution of the measurement apparatus. By combining the Lindblad..."
