  "summary": "Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), have demonstrated remarkable success in variant effect prediction. However, their security and robustness under adversarial manipulation remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Secure Agentic Genomic Evaluator (SAGE), an agentic framework for auditing the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs. SAGE functions through an interpretable and automated risk auditing loop. It injects soft prompt perturba..."
