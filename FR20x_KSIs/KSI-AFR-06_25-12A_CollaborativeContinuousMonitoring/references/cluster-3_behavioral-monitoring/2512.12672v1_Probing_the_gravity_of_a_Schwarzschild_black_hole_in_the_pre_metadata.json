  "summary": "Here, we explore the effect of the cloud of strings (CoS) on the gravitational waveforms of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The EMRI system consists of a supermassive black hole (BH) and a compact stellar mass object moving around it. We begin with studying the test particle motion around the Schwarzschild BH surrounded by a CoS by using the Lagrangian formalism. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the CoS parameter on the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then tu..."
