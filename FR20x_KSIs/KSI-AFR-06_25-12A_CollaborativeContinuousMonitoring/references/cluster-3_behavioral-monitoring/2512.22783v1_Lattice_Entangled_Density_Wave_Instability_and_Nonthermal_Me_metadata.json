  "summary": "The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized nickelates has renewed interest in the broken-symmetry states of their ambient-pressure parent phases, where a density-wave (DW) order emerges and competes with superconductivity, but its microscopic origin remains unresolved. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\\rm DW} \\approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, rev..."
