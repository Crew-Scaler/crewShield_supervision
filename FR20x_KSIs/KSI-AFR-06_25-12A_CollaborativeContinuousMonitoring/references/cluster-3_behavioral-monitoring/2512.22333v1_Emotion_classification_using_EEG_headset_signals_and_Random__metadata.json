  "summary": "Emotions are one of the important components of the human being, thus they are a valuable part of daily activities such as interaction with people, decision making and learning. For this reason, it is important to detect, recognize and understand emotions using computational systems to improve communication between people and machines, which would facilitate the ability of computers to understand the communication between humans. This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classi..."
