  "summary": "Providing timely and meaningful feedback remains a persistent challenge in higher education, especially in large courses where teachers must balance formative depth with scalability. Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offer new opportunities to support feedback processes while maintaining human oversight. This paper presents an study conducted within the AICoFe (AI-based Collaborative Feedback) system, which integrates teacher, peer, and self-assessments of engineering..."
