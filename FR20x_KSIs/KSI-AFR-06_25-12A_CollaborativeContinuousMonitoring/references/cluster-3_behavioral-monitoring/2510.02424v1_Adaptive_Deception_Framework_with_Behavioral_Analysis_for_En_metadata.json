  "summary": "This paper presents CADL (Cognitive-Adaptive Deception Layer), an adaptive deception framework achieving 99.88% detection rate with 0.13% false positive rate on the CICIDS2017 dataset. The framework employs ensemble machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) combined with behavioral profiling to identify and adapt responses to network intrusions. Through a coordinated signal bus architecture, security components share real-time intelligence, enabling collective decision-making. T..."
