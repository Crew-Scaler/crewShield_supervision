  "summary": "The growing presence of unauthorized drones poses significant threats to public safety, underscoring the need for aerial surveillance solutions. This work proposes a cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework enabling drone detection within the existing communication network infrastructure, while maintaining communication services. The system exploits the spatial diversity and coordination of distributed access points (APs) in a cell-free massive MIMO architecture to detect ..."
