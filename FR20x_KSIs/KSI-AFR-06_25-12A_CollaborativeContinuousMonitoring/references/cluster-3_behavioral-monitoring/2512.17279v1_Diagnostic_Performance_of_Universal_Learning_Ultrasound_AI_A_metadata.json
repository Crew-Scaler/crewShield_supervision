  "summary": "IMPORTANCE: Current ultrasound AI remains fragmented into single-task tools, limiting clinical utility compared to versatile modern ultrasound systems.\n  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of single general-purpose deep learning models for multi-organ classification and segmentation.\n  DESIGN: The Universal UltraSound Image Challenge 2025 (UUSIC25) involved developing algorithms on 11,644 images (public/private). Evaluation used an independent, multi-center test set of..."
