  "summary": "Graph-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (GNIDS) have gained significant momentum in detecting sophisticated cyber-attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), within and across organizational boundaries. Though achieving satisfying detection accuracy and demonstrating adaptability to ever-changing attacks and normal patterns, existing GNIDS predominantly assume a centralized data setting. However, flexible data collection is not always realistic or achievable due to increasing co..."
