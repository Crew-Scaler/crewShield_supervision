  "summary": "Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \\textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-C"
