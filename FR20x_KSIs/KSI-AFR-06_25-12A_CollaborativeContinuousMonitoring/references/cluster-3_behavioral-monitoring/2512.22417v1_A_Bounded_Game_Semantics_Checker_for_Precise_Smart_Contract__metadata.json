  "summary": "We present a new approach to finding smart contract vulnerabilities that is precise (no false positives up to our EVM-Yul interpreter), bounded-complete, and, when instrumented with domain knowledge, scales to real-world contracts. Our method is based on game semantics, modelling computation as an interaction between a contract and its environment, reducing reasoning about unknown or malicious external contracts to trace enumeration. We implement this in a tool we refer to as YulToolkit, a bound..."
