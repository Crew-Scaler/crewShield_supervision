  "summary": "Multi-session map merging is crucial for extended autonomous operations in large-scale environments. In this paper, we present GMLD, a learning-based local descriptor framework for large-scale multi-session point cloud map merging that systematically aligns maps collected across different sessions with overlapping regions. The proposed framework employs a keypoint-aware encoder and a plane-based g"
