  "summary": "We use the term re-identification to refer to the process of recovering the original speaker's identity from anonymized speech outputs. Speaker de-identification systems aim to reduce the risk of re-identification, but most evaluations focus only on individual-level measures and overlook broader risks from soft biometric leakage. We introduce the Soft Biometric Leakage Score (SBLS), a unified meth"
