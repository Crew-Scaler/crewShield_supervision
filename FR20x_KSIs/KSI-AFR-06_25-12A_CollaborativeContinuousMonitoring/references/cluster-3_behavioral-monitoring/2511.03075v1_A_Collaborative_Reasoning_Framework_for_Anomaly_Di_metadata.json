  "summary": "The safe deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical settings requires a paradigm that combines human expertise with AI-driven analysis, especially when anomalies are unforeseen. We introduce AURA (Autonomous Resilience Agent), a collaborative framework for anomaly and fault diagnostics in robotics. AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity digital twin (DT), and human-"
