  "summary": "This study provides a comprehensive review of domain adaptation (DA) techniques in vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM). As data-driven models increasingly support the assessment of civil structures, the persistent challenge of transferring knowledge across varying geometries, materials, and environmental conditions remains a major obstacle. DA offers a systematic approach to mitigate these discrepancies by aligning feature distributions between simulated, laboratory, and field dom..."
