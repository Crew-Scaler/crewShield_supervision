  "summary": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) security fundamentally relies on the ability to distinguish genuine quantum correlations from classical eavesdropper simulations, yet existing certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees..."
