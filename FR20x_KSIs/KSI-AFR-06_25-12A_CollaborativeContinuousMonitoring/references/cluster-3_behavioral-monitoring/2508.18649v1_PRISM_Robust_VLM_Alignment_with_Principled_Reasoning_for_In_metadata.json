  "summary": "Safeguarding vision-language models (VLMs) is a critical challenge, as existing methods often suffer from over-defense, which harms utility, or rely on shallow alignment, failing to detect complex threats that require deep reasoning. To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset tha..."
