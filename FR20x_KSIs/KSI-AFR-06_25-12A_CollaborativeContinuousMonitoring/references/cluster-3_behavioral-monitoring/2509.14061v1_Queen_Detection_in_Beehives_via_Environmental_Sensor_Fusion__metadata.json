  "summary": "Queen bee presence is essential for the health and stability of honeybee colonies, yet current monitoring methods rely on manual inspections that are labor-intensive, disruptive, and impractical for large-scale beekeeping. While recent audio-based approaches have shown promise, they often require high power consumption, complex preprocessing, and are susceptible to ambient noise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight, multimodal system for queen detection based on environmental..."
