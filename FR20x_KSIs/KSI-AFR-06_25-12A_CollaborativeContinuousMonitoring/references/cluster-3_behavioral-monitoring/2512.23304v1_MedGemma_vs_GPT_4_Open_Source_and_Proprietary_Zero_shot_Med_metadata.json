  "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce an emerging paradigm for medical imaging by interpreting scans through the lens of extensive clinical knowledge, offering a transformative approach to disease classification. This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-R..."
