  "summary": "The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) marks a significant shift in the mobile network industry. By transforming a traditionally vertically integrated architecture into an open, data-driven one, O-RAN promises to enhance operational flexibility and drive innovation. In this paper, we harness O-RAN's openness to address one critical threat to 5G availability: signaling storms caused by abuse of the "
