  "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multi- and cross-modal integration capabilities. However, their potential for fine-grained emotion understanding remains systematically underexplored. While open-vocabulary multimodal emotion recognition (MER-OV) has emerged as a promising direction to overcome the limitations of closed emotion sets, no compre"
