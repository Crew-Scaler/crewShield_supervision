  "summary": "Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP directly correlates with in"
