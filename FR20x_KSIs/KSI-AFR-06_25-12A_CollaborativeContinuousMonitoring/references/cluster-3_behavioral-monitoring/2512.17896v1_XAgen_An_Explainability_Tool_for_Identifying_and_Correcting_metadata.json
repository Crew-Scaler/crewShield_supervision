  "summary": "As multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in real-world workflows, users with diverse technical backgrounds are now building and refining their own agentic processes. However, these systems can fail in opaque ways, making it difficult for users to observe, understand, and correct errors. We conducted formative interviews with 12 practitioners to identify mismatches between existing observability tools and users' needs. Based on these insights, we des..."
