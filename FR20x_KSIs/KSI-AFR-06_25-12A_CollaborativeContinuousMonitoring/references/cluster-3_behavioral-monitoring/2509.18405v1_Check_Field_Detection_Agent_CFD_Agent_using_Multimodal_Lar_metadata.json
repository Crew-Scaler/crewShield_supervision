  "summary": "Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer..."
