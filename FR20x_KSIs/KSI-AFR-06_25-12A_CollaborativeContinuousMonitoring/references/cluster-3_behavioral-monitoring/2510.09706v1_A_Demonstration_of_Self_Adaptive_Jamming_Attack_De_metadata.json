  "summary": "The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents SAJD- a self-"
