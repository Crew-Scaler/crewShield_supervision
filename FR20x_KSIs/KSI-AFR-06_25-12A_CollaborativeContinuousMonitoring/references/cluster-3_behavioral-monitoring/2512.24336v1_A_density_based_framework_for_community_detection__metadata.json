  "summary": "Community structure in social and collaborative networks often emerges from a complex interplay between structural mechanisms, such as degree heterogeneity and leader-driven attraction, and homophily on node attributes. Existing community detection methods typically focus on these dimensions in isolation, limiting their ability to recover interpretable communities in presence of such mechanisms. I"
