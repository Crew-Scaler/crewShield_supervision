  "summary": "In the evolving landscape of traffic management and vehicle surveillance, efficient license plate detection and recognition are indispensable. Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Rec"
