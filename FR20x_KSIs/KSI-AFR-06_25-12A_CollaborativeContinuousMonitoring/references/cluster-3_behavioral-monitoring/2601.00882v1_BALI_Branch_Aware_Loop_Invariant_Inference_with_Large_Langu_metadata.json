  "summary": "Loop invariants are fundamental for reasoning about the correctness of iterative algorithms. However, deriving suitable invariants remains a challenging and often manual task, particularly for complex programs. In this paper, we introduce BALI, a branch-aware framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) to enhance the inference and verification of loop invariants. Our approach combines automated reasoning with branch-aware static program analysis to improve both precision and scalabili..."
