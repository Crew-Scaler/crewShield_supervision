  "summary": "As LLM-based agents grow more autonomous and multi-modal, ensuring they remain controllable, auditable, and faithful to deployer intent becomes critical. Prior benchmarks measured the propensity for misaligned behavior and showed that agent personalities and tool access significantly influence misalignment. Building on these insights, we propose a Verifiability-First architecture that (1) integrates run-time attestations of agent actions using cryptographic and symbolic methods, (2) embeds light..."
