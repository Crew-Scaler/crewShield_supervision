  "summary": "We present a framework that links equatorial-current-sheet (ECS) physics to catalog-level, phase-averaged gamma-ray pulsar properties. Guided by analytic scalings and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar ``Fundamental Plane'' (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\\dot{\\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radia"
