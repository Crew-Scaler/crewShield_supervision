  "summary": "In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph ..."
