  "summary": "Accurate recognition of human emotional states is critical for effective human-machine interaction. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a reliable source for emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and its direct reflection of neural activity. Nevertheless, variations across recording sessions present a major challenge for model generalization. To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) an..."
