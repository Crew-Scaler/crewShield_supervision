  "summary": "This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Ga..."
