  "summary": "Automotive radar has shown promising developments in environment perception due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse weather conditions. However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity..."
