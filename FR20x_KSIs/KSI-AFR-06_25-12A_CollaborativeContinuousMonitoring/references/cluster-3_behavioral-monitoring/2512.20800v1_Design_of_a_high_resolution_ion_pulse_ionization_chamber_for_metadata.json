  "summary": "Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that contributes significantly to human radiation exposure and must be controlled to avoid concentrations harmful to health.\n  The paper presents an impulse-proportional ionization chamber that is suitable for the direct measurement of low radon concentrations in ambient air and achieves spectroscopic resolutions of 2-3%.\n  This accuracy can be achieved through two novel principles. Firstly, the double-cylindrical, coaxial design of the IC allows fo..."
