  "summary": "We present a lattice-renormalized formalism for configurational tunneling two-level systems (TLS) that overcomes limitations of minimum-energy-path and light-particle models. Derived from the nuclear Hamiltonian, our formulation introduces composite phonon coordinates to capture lattice distortions between degenerate potential wells. This approach resolves deficiencies in prior models and enables "
