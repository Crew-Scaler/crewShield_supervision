  "summary": "We propose a nonparametric method to learn the L\u00e9vy density from probability density data governed by a nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation. We recast the problem as identifying the kernel in a nonlocal integral operator from discrete data, which leads to an ill-posed inverse problem. To regularize it, we construct an adaptive reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) whose kernel is built directly from the data. Under standard source and spectral decay conditions, we show that the reconstruction erro..."
