  "summary": "The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single ..."
