  "summary": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies su..."
