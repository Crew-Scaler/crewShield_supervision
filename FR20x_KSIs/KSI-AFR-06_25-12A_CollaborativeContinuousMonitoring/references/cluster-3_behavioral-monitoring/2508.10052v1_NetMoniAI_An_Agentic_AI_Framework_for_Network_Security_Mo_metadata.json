  "summary": "In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers: autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testb..."
