  "summary": "Fuzzing is a widely used technique for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, which generates transaction sequences to explore the execution paths of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers are falling short in detecting sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific attack transaction sequences with proper inputs to trigger, as they (i) prioritize code coverage over vulnerability discovery, wasting considerable effort on non-vulnerable code regions, and (ii) lack semantic underst..."
