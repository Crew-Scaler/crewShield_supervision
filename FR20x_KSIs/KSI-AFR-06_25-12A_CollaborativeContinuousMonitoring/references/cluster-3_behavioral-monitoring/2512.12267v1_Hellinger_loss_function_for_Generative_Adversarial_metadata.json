  "summary": "We propose Hellinger-type loss functions for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), motivated by the boundedness, symmetry, and robustness properties of the Hellinger distance. We define an adversarial objective based on this divergence and study its statistical properties within a general parametric framework. We establish the existence, uniqueness, consistency, and joint asymptotic nor"
