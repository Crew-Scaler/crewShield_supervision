  "summary": "With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generati..."
