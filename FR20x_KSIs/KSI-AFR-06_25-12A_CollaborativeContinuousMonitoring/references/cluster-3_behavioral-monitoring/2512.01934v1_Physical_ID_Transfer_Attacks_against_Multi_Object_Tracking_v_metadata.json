  "summary": "Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by..."
