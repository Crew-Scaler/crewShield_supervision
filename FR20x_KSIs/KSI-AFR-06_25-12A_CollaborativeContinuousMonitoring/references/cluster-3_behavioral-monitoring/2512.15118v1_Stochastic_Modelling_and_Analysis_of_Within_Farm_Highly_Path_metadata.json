  "summary": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has expanded its host range with recent detections in dairy cattle, raising critical concerns regarding within-herd persistence and cross-species spillover. This study develops a stochastic $SEI_sI_aR-B$ compartmental model to analyse HPAI transmission, explicitly accounting for environmental pathogen reservoirs and noise intensities through Wiener processes. The positivity and boundedness of solutions are established, and the disease-free and endemic equ..."
