  "summary": "In the realm of Cyber-Physical System (CPS), accurately identifying attacks without detailed knowledge of the system's parameters remains a major challenge. When it comes to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), identifying the parameters of vehicle dynamics could be impractical or prohibitively costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework for attack detection in vehicles that effectively addresses the uncertainty in their dynamics. Our method integrates the widely used Un..."
