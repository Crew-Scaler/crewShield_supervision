  "summary": "Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in fir..."
