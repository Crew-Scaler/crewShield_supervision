  "summary": "Increasing evidence shows that AGN with radio detections have more perturbed ionized gas kinematics and higher outflow detection rates, suggesting a link between radio emission and these processes. In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxi..."
