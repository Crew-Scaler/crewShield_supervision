  "summary": "Due to their high equilibrium temperatures ($T_{eq}$ $>$ 2000 K), ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are the best characterized exoplanets to date. However, many questions about their formation, evolution, and atmospheres remain unanswered. Phase curve observations can reveal answers to these questions by constraining multiple atmospheric properties including circulation, albedo, and chemistry. To this end, we simulate and forecast a survey of UHJ atmospheres via phase curve observations with the upcomin..."
