  "summary": "Microquasars (MQs) are Galactic binary systems, consisting of a star and a compact object, a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole, which accretes matter from its companion star and gives rise to relativistic jets. Recent detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $E \\gtrsim 100,\\text{GeV}$) and ultra-high-energy (UHE; $E \\gtrsim 100,\\text{TeV}$) gamma-rays by LHAASO, HAWC and HESS from the MQ V4641 Sgr and SS 433 suggests them as Galactic PeVatrons. In this work, we studied a hadronic origin of th..."
