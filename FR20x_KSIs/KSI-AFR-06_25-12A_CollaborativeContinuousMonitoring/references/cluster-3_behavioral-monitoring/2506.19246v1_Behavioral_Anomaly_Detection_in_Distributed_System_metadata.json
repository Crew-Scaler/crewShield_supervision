  "summary": "This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed collaborative modeling ca"
