  "summary": "The polarization of light is a critically under-utilized, rich source of information in astronomy. For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range o"
