  "summary": "Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are complex interconnected systems used to manage process control within industrial environments, such as chemical processing plants and water treatment facilities. As the modern industrial environment moves towards Internet-facing services, ICSs face an increased risk of attacks that necessitates ICS-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The development of "
