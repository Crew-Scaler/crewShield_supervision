  "summary": "We present results from multi-epoch observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) during its active phase between 8 May and 28 May 2021. The bursts exhibit significant morphological diversity, including multiple sub-bursts, downward frequency drifts, and intrinsic widths ranging from 1.032 - 32.159 ms. Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 2..."
