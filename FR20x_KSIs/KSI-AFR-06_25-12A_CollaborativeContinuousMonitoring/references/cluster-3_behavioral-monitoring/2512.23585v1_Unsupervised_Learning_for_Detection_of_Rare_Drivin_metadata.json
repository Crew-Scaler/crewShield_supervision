  "summary": "The detection of rare and hazardous driving scenarios is a critical challenge for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. This research explores an unsupervised learning framework for detecting rare and extreme driving scenarios using naturalistic driving data (NDD). We leverage the recently proposed Deep Isolation Forest (DIF), an anomaly detection algorithm that combines neura"
