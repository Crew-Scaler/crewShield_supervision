  "summary": "Integrating SDN and the IoT enhances network control and flexibility. DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of adversarial vulnera"
