  "summary": "Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stable spin textures, have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in information storage and processing. They are typically stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the presence of a magnetic field and can be manipulated by electric fields in magnetoelectric systems. Here we investigate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the behavior of skyrmions in a classical Heisenberg magnetoelectric model on the square lattice under co..."
