  "summary": "Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation aims to localize anomalous regions at the pixel level, advancing beyond traditional image-level OOD techniques to better suit real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g"
