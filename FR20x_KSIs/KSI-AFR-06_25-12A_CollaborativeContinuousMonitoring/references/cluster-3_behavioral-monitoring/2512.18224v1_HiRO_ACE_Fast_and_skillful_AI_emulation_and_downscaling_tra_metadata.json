  "summary": "Kilometer-scale simulations of the atmosphere are an important tool for assessing local weather extremes and climate impacts, but computational expense limits their use to small regions, short periods, and limited ensembles. Machine learning offers a pathway to efficiently emulate these high-resolution simulations. Here we introduce HiRO-ACE, a two-stage AI modeling framework combining a stochastic version of the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE2S) with diffusion-based downscaling (HiRO) to generate 3 ..."
