  "summary": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) poses a significant threat to web application security. While Deep Learning (DL) has shown remarkable success in detecting XSS attacks, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the discontinuous nature of its input-output mapping. These adversarial attacks employ mutation-based strategies for different components of XSS attack vectors, allowing adversarial age"
