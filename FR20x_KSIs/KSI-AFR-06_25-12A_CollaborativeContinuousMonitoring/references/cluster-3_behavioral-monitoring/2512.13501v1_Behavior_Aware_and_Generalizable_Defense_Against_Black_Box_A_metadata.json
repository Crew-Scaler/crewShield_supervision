  "summary": "Machine learning based intrusion detection systems are increasingly targeted by black box adversarial attacks, where attackers craft evasive inputs using indirect feedback such as binary outputs or behavioral signals like response time and resource usage. While several defenses have been proposed, including input transformation, adversarial training, and surrogate detection, they often fall short in practice. Most are tailored to specific attack types, require internal model access, or rely on s..."
