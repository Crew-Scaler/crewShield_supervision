  "summary": "Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users, leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently, individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism that effectively addresses password-related risks..."
