  "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of resilience metrics, covering both engineering-based measures, such as fragility-curve modeling, and data-driven approaches, including triangular and trapezoidal representations. Next, the paper examines the interdependencies between power systems resilience and community resilience, addressing socioeconomic and behavioral dimensions, infrastructure interconnections, and the emerging role of resilience hubs. The review then synthesizes state-of-the-ar..."
