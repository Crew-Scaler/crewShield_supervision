  "summary": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time localization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to sophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to deceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly perturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without triggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Tradi..."
