  "summary": "Future AI agents might run autonomously with elevated privileges. If these agents are misaligned, they might abuse these privileges to cause serious damage. The field of AI control develops techniques that make it harder for misaligned AIs to cause such damage, while preserving their usefulness. We introduce BashArena, a setting for studying AI control techniques in security-critical environments."
