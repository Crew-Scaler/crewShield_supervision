  "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their ability to learn representations from graph data. Due to privacy concerns and conflicts of interest that prevent clients from directly sharing graph data with one another, Vertical Graph Federated Learning (VGFL) frameworks have been developed. Recent studies have shown that VGFL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that degrade performa"
