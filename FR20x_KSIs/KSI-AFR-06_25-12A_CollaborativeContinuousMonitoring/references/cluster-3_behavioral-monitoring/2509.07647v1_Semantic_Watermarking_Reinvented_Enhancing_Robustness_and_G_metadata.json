  "summary": "Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that reduces the vulnerability of semantic waterma..."
