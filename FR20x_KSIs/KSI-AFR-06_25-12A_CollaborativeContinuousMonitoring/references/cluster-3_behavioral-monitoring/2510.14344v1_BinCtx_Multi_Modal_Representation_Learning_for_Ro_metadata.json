  "summary": "Mobile app markets host millions of apps, yet undesired behaviors (e.g., disruptive ads, illegal redirection, payment deception) remain hard to catch because they often do not rely on permission-protected APIs and can be easily camouflaged via UI or metadata edits. We present BINCTX, a learning approach that builds multi-modal representations of an app from (i) a global bytecode-as-image view that"
