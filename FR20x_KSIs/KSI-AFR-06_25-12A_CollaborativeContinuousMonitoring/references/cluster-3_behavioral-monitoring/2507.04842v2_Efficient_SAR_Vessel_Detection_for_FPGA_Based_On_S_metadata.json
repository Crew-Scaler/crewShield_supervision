  "summary": "Rapid analysis of satellite imagery within minutes-to-hours of acquisition is increasingly vital for many remote sensing applications, and is an essential component for developing next-generation autonomous and distributed satellite systems. On-satellite machine learning (ML) has the potential for such rapid analysis, by overcoming latency associated with intermittent satellite connectivity to gro"
