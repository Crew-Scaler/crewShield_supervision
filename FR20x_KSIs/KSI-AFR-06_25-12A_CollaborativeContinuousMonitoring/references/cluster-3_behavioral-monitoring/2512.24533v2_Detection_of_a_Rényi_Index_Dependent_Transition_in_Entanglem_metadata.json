  "summary": "The scaling of entanglement with subsystem size encodes key information about phases and criticality, but the von Neumann entropy is costly to access in experiments and simulations, often requiring full state tomography. The second R\u00e9nyi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the gr..."
