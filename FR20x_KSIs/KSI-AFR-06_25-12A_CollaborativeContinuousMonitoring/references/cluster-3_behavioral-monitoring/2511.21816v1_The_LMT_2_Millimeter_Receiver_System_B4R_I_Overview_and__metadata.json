  "summary": "We report on the results of the on-sky test and science demonstration conducted with the 2 mm receiver system, B4R, on the 50 m Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), located at an altitude of 4600 m in Mexico. The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identif..."
