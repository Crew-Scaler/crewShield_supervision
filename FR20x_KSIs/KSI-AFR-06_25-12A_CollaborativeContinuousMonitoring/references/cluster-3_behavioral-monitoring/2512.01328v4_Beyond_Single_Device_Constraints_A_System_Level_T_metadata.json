  "summary": "Photon detection, a fundamental quantum technology, is traditionally treated as a fixed device-level operation governed by intrinsic properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). High-performance detection has therefore largely relied on superconducting technologies whose requirement for cryogenic operation imposes substantial infrastructure constraints, limiting scalable deployments. Here, the en"
