  "summary": "If the phase space-based Sudarshan-Glauber distribution, $P_\u03c1$, has negative values the quantum state, $\u03c1$, it describes is nonclassical. Due to $P$'s singular behavior this simple criterion is impractical to use. Recent work [Bohmann and Agudelo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 133601 (2020)] presented a general, sensitive, and noise-tolerant certification functional, $\u03be_{P}$, for the detection of non-clas"
