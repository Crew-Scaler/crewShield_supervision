  "summary": "The integration of Terrestrial Networks (TN) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), including 5G Advanced/6G and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, high-altitude platforms (HAPS), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), is redefining the landscape of global connectivity. This paper introduces a new system-level security framework for 5G Advanced/6G IoT-integrated TN-NTN architectures with AI-native-enabled cloud security. Due to the heterogeneity, scale,..."
