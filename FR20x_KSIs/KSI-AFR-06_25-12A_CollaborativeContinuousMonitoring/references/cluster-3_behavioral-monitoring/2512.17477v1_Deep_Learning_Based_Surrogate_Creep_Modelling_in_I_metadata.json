  "summary": "Time-dependent deformation, particularly creep, in high-temperature alloys such as Inconel 625 is a key factor in the long-term reliability of components used in aerospace and energy systems. Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run.
