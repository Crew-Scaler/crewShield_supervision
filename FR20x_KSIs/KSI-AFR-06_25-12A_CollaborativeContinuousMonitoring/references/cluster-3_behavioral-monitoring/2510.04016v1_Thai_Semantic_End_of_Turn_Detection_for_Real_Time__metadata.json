  "summary": "Fluid voice-to-voice interaction requires reliable and low-latency detection of when a user has finished speaking. Traditional audio-silence end-pointers add hundreds of milliseconds of delay and fail under hesitations or language-specific phenomena. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic study of Thai text-only end-of-turn (EOT) detection for real-time agents. We compare zero-shot and"
