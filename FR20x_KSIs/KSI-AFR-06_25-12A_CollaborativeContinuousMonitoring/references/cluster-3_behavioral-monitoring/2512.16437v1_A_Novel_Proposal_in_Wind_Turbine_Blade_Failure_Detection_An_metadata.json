  "summary": "This paper presents a novel methodology for detecting faults in wind turbine blades using com-putational learning techniques. The study evaluates two models: the first employs logistic regression, which outperformed neural networks, decision trees, and the naive Bayes method, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fault-related patterns. The second model leverages clustering and achieves superior performance in terms of precision and data segmentation. The results indicate that clusterin..."
