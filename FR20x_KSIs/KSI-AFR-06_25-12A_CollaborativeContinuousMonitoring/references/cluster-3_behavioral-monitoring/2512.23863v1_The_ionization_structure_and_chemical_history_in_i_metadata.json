  "summary": "Study the ionized gas in metal-poor environments is key to understanding the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution. However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU"
