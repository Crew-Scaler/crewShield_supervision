  "summary": "Backdoor attacks pose severe security threats to deep neural networks by embedding malicious triggers that force misclassification. While machine unlearning techniques can remove backdoor behaviors, current methods lack transparency and real-time interpretability. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) into the unlearning proce"
