  "summary": "Power transformers are critical assets in power networks, whose reliability directly impacts grid resilience and stability. Traditional condition monitoring approaches, often rule-based or purely physics-based, struggle with uncertainty, limited data availability, and the complexity of modern operating conditions. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) provide powerful tools to complement and extend these methods, enabling more accurate diagnostics, prognostics, and control. In this two-part s..."
