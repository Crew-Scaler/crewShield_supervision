  "summary": "The subject of this research is the development of an intelligent, integrated framework for the automated inspection of photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure that addresses the critical shortcomings of conventional methods, including thermal palette bias, data redundancy, and high communication bandwidth requirements. The goal of this study is to design, develop, and validate a comprehensive, multi-modal system that fully automates the monitoring workflow, from data acquisition to the generation of a..."
