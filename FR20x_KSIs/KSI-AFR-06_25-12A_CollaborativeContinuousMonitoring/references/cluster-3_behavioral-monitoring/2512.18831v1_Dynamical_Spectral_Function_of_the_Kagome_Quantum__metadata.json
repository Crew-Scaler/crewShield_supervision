  "summary": "Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host exotic fractionalized magnetic and gauge-field excitations whose microscopic origins and experimental verification remain frustratingly elusive. In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-netwo"
