  "summary": "When a droplet impacts a liquid film, a vortex ring form and govern momentum and species transport. We experimentally investigate vortex ring formation, propagation and instability during droplet impact onto liquid films, with particular emphasis on vortex ring-wall interactions. Particle image velocimetry and laser-induced fluorescence are used to study the effects of Reynolds number Re, Weber number We and dimensionless film thickness \u03b4over ranges Re \\leq 3900, We \\leq 61 and 0.09 \\leq \u03b4\\leq 1..."
