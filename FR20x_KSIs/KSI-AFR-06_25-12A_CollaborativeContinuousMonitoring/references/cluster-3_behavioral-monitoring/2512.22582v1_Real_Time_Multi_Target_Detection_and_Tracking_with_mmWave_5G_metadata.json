  "summary": "We demonstrate a real-time implementation of multi-target detection and tracking using 5G New Radio (NR) physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) waveform with 400 MHz bandwidth at 28 GHz carrier frequency. The hardware platform is built on a radio frequency system-on-chip (RFSoC) 4x2 board connected with a pair of Sivers EVK02001 mmWave beamformers for transmission and reception. The entire sensing transceiver processing and fast beam control are realized purely in the programmable logic (PL) p..."
