  "summary": "We present new timing models and update our previous ones for the rotational evolution of seven young energetic pulsars, including four of the top five in spin-down luminosity Edot among all known pulsars. For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing mod..."
