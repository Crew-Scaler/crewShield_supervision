  "summary": "We develop a robust linear-quadratic mean-field control framework for systemic risk under model uncertainty, in which a central bank jointly optimizes interest rate policy and supervisory monitoring intensity against adversarial distortions. Our model features multiple policy instruments with interactive dynamics, implemented via a variance weight that depends on the policy rate, generating coupli"
