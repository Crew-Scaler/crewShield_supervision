  "summary": "We present a novel modularized end-to-end framework for legged reactive navigation in complex dynamic environments using a single light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The system comprises four simulation-trained modules: three reinforcement-learning (RL) policies for locomotion, safety shielding, and navigation, and a transformer-based exteroceptive estimator that processes raw point-cloud inputs. This modular decomposition of complex legged motor-control tasks enables lightweight neural ..."
