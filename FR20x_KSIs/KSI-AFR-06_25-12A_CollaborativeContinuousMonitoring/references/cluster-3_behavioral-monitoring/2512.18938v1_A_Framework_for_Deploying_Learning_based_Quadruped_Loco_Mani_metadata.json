  "summary": "Quadruped mobile manipulators offer strong potential for agile loco-manipulation but remain difficult to control and transfer reliably from simulation to reality. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for whole-body control, yet most frameworks are proprietary and hard to reproduce on real hardware. We present an open pipeline for training, benchmarking, and deploying RL-based controllers on the Unitree B1 quadruped with a Z1 arm. The framework unifies sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer thr..."
