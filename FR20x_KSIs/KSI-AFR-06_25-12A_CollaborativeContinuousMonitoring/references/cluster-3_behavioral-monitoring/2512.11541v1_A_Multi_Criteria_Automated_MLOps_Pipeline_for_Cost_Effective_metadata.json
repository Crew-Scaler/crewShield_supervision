  "summary": "The performance of machine learning (ML) models often deteriorates when the underlying data distribution changes over time, a phenomenon known as data distribution drift. When this happens, ML models need to be retrained and redeployed. ML Operations (MLOps) is often manual, i.e., humans trigger the process of model retraining and redeployment. In this work, we present an automated MLOps pipeline designed to address neural network classifier retraining in response to significant data distributio..."
