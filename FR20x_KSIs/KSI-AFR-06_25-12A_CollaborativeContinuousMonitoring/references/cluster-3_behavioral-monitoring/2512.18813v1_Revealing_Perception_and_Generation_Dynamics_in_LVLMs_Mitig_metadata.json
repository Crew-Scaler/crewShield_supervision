  "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet hallucinations remain a persistent challenge. This work presents a systematic analysis of the internal evolution of visual perception and token generation in LVLMs, revealing two key patterns. First, perception follows a three-stage GATE process: early layers perform a Global scan, intermediate layers Approach and Tighten on core content, and later layers Explore supplementary regions. Second, generation exhibits an SAD..."
