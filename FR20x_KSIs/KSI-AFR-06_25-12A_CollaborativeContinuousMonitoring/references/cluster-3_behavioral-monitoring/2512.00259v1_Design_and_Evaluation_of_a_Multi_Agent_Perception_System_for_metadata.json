  "summary": "Autonomous Flying Networks (FNs) are emerging as a key enabler of on-demand connectivity in dynamic and infrastructure-limited environments. However, current approaches mainly focus on UAV placement, routing, and resource management, neglecting the autonomous perception of users and their service demands - a critical capability for zero-touch network operation.\n  This paper presents the Multi-Agent Perception System (MAPS), a modular and scalable system that leverages multi-modal large language ..."
