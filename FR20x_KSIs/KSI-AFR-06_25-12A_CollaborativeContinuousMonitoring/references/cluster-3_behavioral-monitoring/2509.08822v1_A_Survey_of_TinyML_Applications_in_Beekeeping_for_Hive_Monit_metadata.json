  "summary": "Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non..."
