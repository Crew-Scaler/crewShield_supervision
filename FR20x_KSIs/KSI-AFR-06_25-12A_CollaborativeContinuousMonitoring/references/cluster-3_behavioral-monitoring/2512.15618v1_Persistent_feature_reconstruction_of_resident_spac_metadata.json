  "summary": "With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar ("
