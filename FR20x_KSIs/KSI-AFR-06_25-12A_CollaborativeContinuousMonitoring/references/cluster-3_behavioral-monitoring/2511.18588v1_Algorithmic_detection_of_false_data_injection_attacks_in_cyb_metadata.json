  "summary": "This article introduces an anomaly detection based algorithm (AD-CPS) to detect false data injection attacks that fall under the category of data deception/integrity attacks, but with arbitrary information structure, in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) modeled as stochastic linear time-invariant systems. The core idea of this data-driven algorithm is based on the fact that an honest state (one not compromised by adversaries) generated by the CPS should concentrate near its weighted empirical mean o..."
