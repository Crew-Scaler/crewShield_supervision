  "summary": "The quantum internet is a rapidly developing technological reality, yet, it remains unclear what kind of quantum network structures might emerge. Since indirect quantum communication is already feasible and preserves absolute security of the communication channel, a new node joining the quantum network does not need to connect directly to its desired target. Instead, in our proposed quantum preferential attachment model, it uniformly randomly connects to any node within the proximity of the targ..."
