  "summary": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used for distribution learning, yet their classical formulations remain theoretically fragile, with ill-posed objectives, unstable training dynamics, and limited interpretability. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model.
