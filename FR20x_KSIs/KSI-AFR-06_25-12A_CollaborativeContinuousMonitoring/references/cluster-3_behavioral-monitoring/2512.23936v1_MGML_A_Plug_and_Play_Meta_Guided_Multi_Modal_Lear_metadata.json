  "summary": "Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge"
