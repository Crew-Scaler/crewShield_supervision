  "summary": "An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting co"
