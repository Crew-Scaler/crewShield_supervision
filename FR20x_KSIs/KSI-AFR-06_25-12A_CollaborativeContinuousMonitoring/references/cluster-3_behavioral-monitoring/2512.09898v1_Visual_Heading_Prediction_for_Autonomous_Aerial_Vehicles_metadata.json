  "summary": "The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is increasingly central to the development of intelligent autonomous systems for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data..."
