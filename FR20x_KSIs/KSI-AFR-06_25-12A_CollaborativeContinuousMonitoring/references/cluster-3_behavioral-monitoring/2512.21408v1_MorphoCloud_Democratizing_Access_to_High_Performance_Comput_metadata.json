  "summary": "The digitization of biological specimens has revolutionized the field of morphology, creating large collections of 3D data, and microCT in particular. This revolution was initially supported by the development of open-source software tools, specifically the development of SlicerMorph extension to the open-source image analytics platform 3D Slicer. Through SlicerMorph and 3D Slicer, biologists, morphologists and scientists in related fields have all the necessary tools to import, visualize and an..."
