  "summary": "This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image "
