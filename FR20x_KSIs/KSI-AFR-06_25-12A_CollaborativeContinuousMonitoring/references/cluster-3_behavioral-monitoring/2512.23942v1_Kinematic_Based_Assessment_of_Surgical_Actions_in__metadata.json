  "summary": "Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training.
