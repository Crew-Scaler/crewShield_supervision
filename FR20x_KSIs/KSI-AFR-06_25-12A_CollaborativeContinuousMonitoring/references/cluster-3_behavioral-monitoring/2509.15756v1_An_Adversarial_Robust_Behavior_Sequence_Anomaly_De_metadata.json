  "summary": "Sequential deep learning models (e.g., RNN and LSTM) can learn the sequence features of software behaviors, such as API or syscall sequences. However, recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware classifiers. In this "
