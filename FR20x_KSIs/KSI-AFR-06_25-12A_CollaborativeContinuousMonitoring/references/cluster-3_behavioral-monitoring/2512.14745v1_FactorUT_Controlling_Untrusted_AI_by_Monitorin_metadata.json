  "summary": "As AI capabilities advance, we increasingly rely on powerful models to decompose complex tasks $\\unicode{x2013}$ but what if the decomposer itself is malicious? Factored cognition protocols decompose complex tasks into simpler child tasks: one model creates the decomposition, while other models implement the child tasks in isolation. Prior work uses trusted (weaker but reliable) models for decompo"
