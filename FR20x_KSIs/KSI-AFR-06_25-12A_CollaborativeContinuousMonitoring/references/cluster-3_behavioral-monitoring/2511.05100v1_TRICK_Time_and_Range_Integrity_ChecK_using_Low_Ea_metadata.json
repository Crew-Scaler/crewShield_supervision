  "summary": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) information to over 4 billion devices worldwide. Despite its pervasive use in safety critical and high precision applications, GNSS remains vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Cryptographic enhancements, such as the use of TESLA protocol in Galileo, to provide navigation message authentication do not mitigate "
