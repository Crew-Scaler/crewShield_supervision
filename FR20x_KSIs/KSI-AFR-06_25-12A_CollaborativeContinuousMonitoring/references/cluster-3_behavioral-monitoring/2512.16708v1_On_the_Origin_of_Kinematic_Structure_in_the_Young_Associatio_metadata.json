  "summary": "The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic..."
