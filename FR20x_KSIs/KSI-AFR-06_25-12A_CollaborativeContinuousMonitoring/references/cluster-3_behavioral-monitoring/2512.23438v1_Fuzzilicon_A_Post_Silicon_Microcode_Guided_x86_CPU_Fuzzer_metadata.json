  "summary": "Modern CPUs are black boxes, proprietary, and increasingly characterized by sophisticated microarchitectural flaws that evade traditional analysis. While some of these critical vulnerabilities have been uncovered through cumbersome manual effort, building an automated and systematic vulnerability detection framework for real-world post-silicon processors remains a challenge.\n  In this paper, we present Fuzzilicon, the first post-silicon fuzzing framework for real-world x86 CPUs that brings deep ..."
