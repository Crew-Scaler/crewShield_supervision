  "summary": "In Kigali, Rwanda, motorcycle taxis are a primary mode of transportation, often navigating unpredictably and disregarding traffic rules, posing significant challenges for autonomous driving systems. This study compares four object detection models--YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet--for motorbike detection using a custom dataset of 198 images collected in Kigali. Implemented in PyTorch with transfer learning, the models were evaluated for accuracy, localization, and inference speed to ass..."
