  "summary": "SmartFlow is a multi-layered framework that integrates Reinforcement Learning and Agentic AI to address the dynamic rebalancing problem in urban bike-sharing services. Its architecture separates strategic, tactical, and communication functions for clarity and scalability. At the strategic level, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent, trained in a high-fidelity simulation of New Yorks Citi Bike network, learns robust rebalancing policies by modelling the challenge as a Markov Decision Process. These high-..."
