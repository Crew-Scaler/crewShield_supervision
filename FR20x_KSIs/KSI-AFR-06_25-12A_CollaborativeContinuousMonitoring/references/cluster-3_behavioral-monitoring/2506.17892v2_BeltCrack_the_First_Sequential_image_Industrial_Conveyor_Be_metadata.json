  "summary": "Conveyor belts are important equipment in modern industry, widely applied in production and manufacturing. Their health is much critical to operational efficiency and safety. Cracks are a major threat to belt health. Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However, existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement sce..."
