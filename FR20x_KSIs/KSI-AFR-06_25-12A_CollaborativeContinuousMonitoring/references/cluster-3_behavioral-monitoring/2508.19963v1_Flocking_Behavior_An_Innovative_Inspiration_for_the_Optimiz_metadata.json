  "summary": "Optimizing modern production plants using the job-shop principle is a known hard problem. For very large plants, like semiconductor fabs, the problem becomes unsolvable on a plant-wide scale in a reasonable amount of time using classical linear optimization. An alternative approach is the use of swarm intelligence algorithms. These have been applied to the job-shop problem before, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the solution space, but they can be implemented in..."
