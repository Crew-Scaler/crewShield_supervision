  "summary": "We present a privacy-preserving telemetry aggregation scheme. Our underlying frequency estimation routine works within the framework of differential privacy. The design philosophy follows a client-server architecture. Furthermore, the system uses a local differential privacy scheme where data gets randomized on the client before submitting the request to the resource server. This scheme allows for"
