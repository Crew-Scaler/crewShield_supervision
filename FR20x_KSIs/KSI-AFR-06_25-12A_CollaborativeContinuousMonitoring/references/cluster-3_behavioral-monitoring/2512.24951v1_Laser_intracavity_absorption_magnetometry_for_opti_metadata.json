  "summary": "Intracavity absorption spectroscopy (ICAS) is a well-established technique for detecting weak absorption signals with ultrahigh sensitivity. Here, we extend this concept to magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We introduce laser intracavity absorption magnetometry (LICAM), a concept that is in principle applicable to a broader class of optical quantum sensors, including opt"
