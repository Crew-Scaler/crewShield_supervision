  "summary": "While imitation learning has shown impressive results in single-task robot manipulation, scaling it to multi-task settings remains a fundamental challenge due to issues such as suboptimal demonstrations, trajectory noise, and behavioral multi-modality. Existing skill-based methods attempt to address this by decomposing actions into reusable abstractions, but they often rely on fixed-length segment"
