  "summary": "Accurate and uncertainty-aware degradation estimation is essential for predictive maintenance in safety-critical systems like rotating machinery with rolling-element bearings. Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, an..."
