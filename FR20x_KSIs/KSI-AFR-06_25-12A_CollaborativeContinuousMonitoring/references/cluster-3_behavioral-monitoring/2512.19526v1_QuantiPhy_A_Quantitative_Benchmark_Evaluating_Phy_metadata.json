  "summary": "Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video obs"
