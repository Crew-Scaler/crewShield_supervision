  "summary": "Gravitational wave echoes serve as probes for quantum horizon corrections. While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the ce..."
