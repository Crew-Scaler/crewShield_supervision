  "summary": "Urban transportation systems face increasing resilience challenges from extreme weather events, but current assessment methods rely on surface-level recovery indicators that miss hidden structural damage. Existing approaches cannot distinguish between true recovery and \"false recovery,\" where traffic metrics normalize, but the underlying system dynamics permanently degrade. To address this, a new "
