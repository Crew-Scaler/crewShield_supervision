Tor employs a distributed protocol among nine hard-coded Directory Authority (DA) servers to securely disseminate information about these relays to produce a new consensus document every hour. With a straightforward voting mechanism to ensure consistency, the protocol is expected to be secure even when a minority of those authorities get compromised. However, the current co..."
