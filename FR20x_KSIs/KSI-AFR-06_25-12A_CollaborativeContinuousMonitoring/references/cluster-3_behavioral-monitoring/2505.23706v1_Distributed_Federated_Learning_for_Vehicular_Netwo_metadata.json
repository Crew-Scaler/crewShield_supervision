  "summary": "In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale, high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle networks. To overcome thes"
