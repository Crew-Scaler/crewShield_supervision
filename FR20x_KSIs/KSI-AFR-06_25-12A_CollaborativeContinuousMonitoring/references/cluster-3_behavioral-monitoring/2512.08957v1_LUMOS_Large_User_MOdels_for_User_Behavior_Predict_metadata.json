  "summary": "User behavior prediction at scale remains a critical challenge for online B2C platforms. Traditional approaches rely heavily on task-specific models and domain-specific feature engineering. This is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise and therefore not scalable. We present LUMOS (Large User MOdel Series), a transformer-based architecture that eliminates task-spe"
