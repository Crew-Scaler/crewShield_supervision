  "summary": "Respiratory sound classification is hindered by the limited size, high noise levels, and severe class imbalance of benchmark datasets like ICBHI 2017. While Transformer-based models offer powerful feature extraction capabilities, they are prone to overfitting and often converge to sharp minima in the loss landscape when trained on such constrained medical data. To address this, we introduce a fram"
