  "summary": "Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\u03b4}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demons..."
