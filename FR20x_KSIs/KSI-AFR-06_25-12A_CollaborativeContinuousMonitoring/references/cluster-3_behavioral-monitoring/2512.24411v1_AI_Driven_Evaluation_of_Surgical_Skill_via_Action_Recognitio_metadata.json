  "summary": "The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting ..."
