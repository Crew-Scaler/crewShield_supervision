  "summary": "This paper presents a system for procedurally generating agent-based narratives using large language models (LLMs). Users could drag and drop multiple agents and objects into a scene, with each entity automatically assigned semantic metadata describing its identity, role, and potential interactions. The scene structure is then serialized into a natural language prompt and sent to an LLM, which returns a structured string describing a sequence of actions and interactions among agents and objects...."
