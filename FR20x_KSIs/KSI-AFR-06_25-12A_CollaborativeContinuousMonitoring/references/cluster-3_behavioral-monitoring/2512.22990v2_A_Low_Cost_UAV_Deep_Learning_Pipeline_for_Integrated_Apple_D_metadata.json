  "summary": "Apple orchards require timely disease detection, fruit quality assessment, and yield estimation, yet existing UAV-based systems address such tasks in isolation and often rely on costly multispectral sensors. This paper presents a unified, low-cost RGB-only UAV-based orchard intelligent pipeline integrating ResNet50 for leaf disease detection, VGG 16 for apple freshness determination, and YOLOv8 for real-time apple detection and localization. The system runs on an ESP32-CAM and Raspberry Pi, prov..."
