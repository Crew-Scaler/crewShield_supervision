  "summary": "The stellar evolution of lithium-rich (Li-rich) giant stars at very low metallicities remains largely unexplored to date. Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observatio..."
