  "summary": "Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) is essential for quality management but is limited by its reliance on often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern, complex manufacturing environments. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that enhances SPC by integrating the distribution free, model agnostic guarantees of Conformal Prediction. We propose two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts, which visualize process uncertainty and enable..."
