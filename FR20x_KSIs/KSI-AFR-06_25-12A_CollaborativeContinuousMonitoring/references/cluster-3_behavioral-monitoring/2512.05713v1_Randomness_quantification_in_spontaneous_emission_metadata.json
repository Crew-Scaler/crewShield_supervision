  "summary": "Quantum coherence serves as a fundamental resource for generating intrinsic randomness, yet the quantification of randomness in quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on spontaneous emission has remained largely phenomenological. Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneo..."
