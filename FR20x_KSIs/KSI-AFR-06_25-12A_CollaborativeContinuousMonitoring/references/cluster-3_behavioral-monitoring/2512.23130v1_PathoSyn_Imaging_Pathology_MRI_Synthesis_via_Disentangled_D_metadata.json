  "summary": "We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthes..."
