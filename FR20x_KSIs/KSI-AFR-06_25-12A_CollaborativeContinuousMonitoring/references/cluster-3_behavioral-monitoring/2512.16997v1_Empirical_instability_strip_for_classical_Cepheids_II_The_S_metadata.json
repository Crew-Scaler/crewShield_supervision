  "summary": "Aims. This study aims to determine empirical intrinsic edges of the classical Cepheids instability strip (IS) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy, considering various effects that alter its shape, and compare them with theoretical models and other galaxies. Methods. We used the data of classical fundamental-mode (F) and first-overtone mode (1O) SMC Cepheids from the OGLE-IV variable star catalog, with the final cleaned sample including 2388 F and 1560 1O Cepheids. The IS borders are deter..."
