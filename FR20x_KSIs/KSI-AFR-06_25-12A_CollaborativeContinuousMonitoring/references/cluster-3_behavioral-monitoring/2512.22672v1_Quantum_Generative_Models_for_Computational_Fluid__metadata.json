  "summary": "This paper presents the first application of quantum generative models to learned latent space representations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. While recent work has explored quantum models for learning statistical properties of fluid systems, the combination of discrete latent space compression with quantum generative sampling for CFD remains unexplored. We develop a GPU-accelerated La"
