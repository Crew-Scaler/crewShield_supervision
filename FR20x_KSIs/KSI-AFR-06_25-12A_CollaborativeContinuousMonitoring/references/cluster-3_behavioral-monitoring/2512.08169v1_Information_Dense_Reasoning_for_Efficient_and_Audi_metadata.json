  "summary": "Security Operations Centers face massive, heterogeneous alert streams under minute-level service windows, creating the Alert Triage Latency Paradox: verbose reasoning chains ensure accuracy and compliance but incur prohibitive latency and token costs, while minimal chains sacrifice transparency and auditability. Existing solutions fail: signature systems are brittle, anomaly methods lack actionabi"
