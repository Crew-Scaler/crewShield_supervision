  "summary": "Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the correct \\emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an increasingly complex challenge. We present the \\textbf{Automated Vehicle Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \\emph{multi-view} perception system that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver \\emph{variant-aware"
