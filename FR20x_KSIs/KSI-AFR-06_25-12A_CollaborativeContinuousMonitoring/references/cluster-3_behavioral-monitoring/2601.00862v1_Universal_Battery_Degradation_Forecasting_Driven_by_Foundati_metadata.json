  "summary": "Accurate forecasting of battery capacity fade is essential for the safety, reliability, and long-term efficiency of energy storage systems. However, the strong heterogeneity across cell chemistries, form factors, and operating conditions makes it difficult to build a single model that generalizes beyond its training domain. This work proposes a unified capacity forecasting framework that maintains robust performance across diverse chemistries and usage scenarios. We curate 20 public aging datase..."
