  "summary": "Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and "
