  "summary": "Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with an estimated 110 million mines deployed across 60 countries, claiming approximately 26,000 casualties annually. Current detection methods are hazardous, inefficient, and prohibitively expensive. We present the Adaptive Multispectral Landmine Identification Dataset (AMLID), the first open-source dataset combining Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) imagery for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based landmine detection. AMLID compr..."
