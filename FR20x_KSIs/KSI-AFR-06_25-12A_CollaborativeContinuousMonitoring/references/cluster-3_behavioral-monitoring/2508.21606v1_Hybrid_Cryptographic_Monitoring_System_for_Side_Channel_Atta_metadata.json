  "summary": "AES-128 encryption is theoretically secure but vulnerable in practical deployments due to timing and fault injection attacks on embedded systems. This work presents a lightweight dual-detection framework combining statistical thresholding and machine learning (ML) for real-time anomaly detection. By simulating anomalies via delays and ciphertext corruption, we collect timing and data features to evaluate two strategies: (1) a statistical threshold method based on execution time and (2) a Random ..."
