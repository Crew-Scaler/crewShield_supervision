  "summary": "Autonomous aerial navigation in dense natural environments remains challenging due to limited visibility, thin and irregular obstacles, GNSS-denied operation, and frequent perceptual degradation. This work presents an improved deep learning-based navigation framework that integrates semantically enhanced depth encoding with neural motion-primitive evaluation for robust flight in cluttered forests. Several modules are incorporated on top of the original sevae-ORACLE algorithm to address limitatio..."
