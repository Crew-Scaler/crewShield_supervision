  "summary": "Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationall..."
