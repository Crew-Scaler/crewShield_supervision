  "summary": "In regulated domains such as finance, the integrity and governance of data pipelines are critical - yet existing systems treat data quality control (QC) as an isolated preprocessing step rather than a first-class system component. We present a unified AI-driven Data QC and DataOps Management framework that embeds rule-based, statistical, and AI-based QC methods into a continuous, governed layer spanning ingestion, model pipelines, and downstream applications. Our architecture integrates open-sou..."
