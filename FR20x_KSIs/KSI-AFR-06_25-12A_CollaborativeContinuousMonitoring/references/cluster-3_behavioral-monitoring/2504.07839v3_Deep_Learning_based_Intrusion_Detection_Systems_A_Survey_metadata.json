  "summary": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have long been a hot topic in the cybersecurity community. In recent years, with the introduction of deep learning (DL) techniques, IDS have made great progress due to their increasing generalizability. The rationale behind this is that by learning the underlying patterns of known system behaviors, IDS detection can be generalized to intrusions that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. In this survey, we refer to this type of IDS as DL-based IDS (DL-IDS). From the ..."
