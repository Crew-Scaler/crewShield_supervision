  "summary": "As machine learning (ML) becomes an integral part of high-autonomy systems, it is critical to ensure the trustworthiness of learning-enabled software systems (LESS). Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic pres..."
