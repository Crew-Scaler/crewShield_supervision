  "summary": "Bioprinting technology has advanced significantly in the fabrication of tissue-like constructs with complex geometries for regenerative medicine. However, maintaining the structural integrity of bioprinted materials remains a major challenge, primarily due to the frequent and unexpected formation of hidden defects. Traditional defect detection methods often require physical contact that may not be suitable for hydrogel-based biomaterials due to their inherently soft nature, making non-invasive a..."
