  "summary": "We use a $\u03c6^{4}$ quantum field theory with inhomogeneous couplings and explicit symmetry-breaking to model an ensemble of financial time series from the S$\\&$P 500 index. The continuum nature of the $\u03c6^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $\u03c6^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as th..."
