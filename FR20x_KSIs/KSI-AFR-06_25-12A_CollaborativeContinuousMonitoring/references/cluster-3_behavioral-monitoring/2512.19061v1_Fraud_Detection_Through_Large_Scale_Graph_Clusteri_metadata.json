  "summary": "Collaborative fraud, where multiple fraudulent accounts coordinate to exploit online payment systems, poses significant challenges due to the formation of complex network structures. Traditional detection methods that rely solely on high-confidence identity links suffer from limited coverage, while approaches using all available linkages often result in fragmented graphs with reduced clustering ef"
