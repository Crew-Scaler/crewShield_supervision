  "summary": "We present a novel methodology for modelling, visualising, and analysing cyber threats, attack paths, as well as their impact on user services in enterprise or infrastructure networks of digital devices and services they provide. Using probabilistic methods to track the propagation of an attack through attack graphs, via the service or application layers, and on physical communication networks, our model enables us to analyse cyber attacks at different levels of detail. Understanding the propaga..."
