  "summary": "In-cabin driver monitoring systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and the Google Coral development board with an Edge Tensor Processing Unit (Edge TPU) accelerator. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a..."
