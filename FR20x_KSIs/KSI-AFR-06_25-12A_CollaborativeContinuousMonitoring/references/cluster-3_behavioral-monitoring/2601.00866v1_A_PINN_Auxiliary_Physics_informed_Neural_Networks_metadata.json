  "summary": "Recent advancements in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants have garnered substantial focus from researchers due to their effectiveness in solving both forward and inverse problems governed by differential equations. In this research, a modified Auxiliary physics-informed neural network (A-PINN) framework with balanced adaptive optimizers is proposed for the analysis of stru"
