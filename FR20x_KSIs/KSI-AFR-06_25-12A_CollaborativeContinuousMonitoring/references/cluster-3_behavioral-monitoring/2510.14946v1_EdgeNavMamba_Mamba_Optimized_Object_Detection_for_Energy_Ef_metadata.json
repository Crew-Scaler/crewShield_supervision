  "summary": "Deployment of efficient and accurate Deep Learning models has long been a challenge in autonomous navigation, particularly for real-time applications on resource-constrained edge devices. Edge devices are limited in computing power and memory, making model efficiency and compression essential. In this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement learning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an efficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the detector, we introduc..."
