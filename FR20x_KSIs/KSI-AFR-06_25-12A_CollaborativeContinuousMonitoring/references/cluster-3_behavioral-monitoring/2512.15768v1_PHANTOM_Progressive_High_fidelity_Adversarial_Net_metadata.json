  "summary": "The scarcity of cyberattack data hinders the development of robust intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces PHANTOM, a novel adversarial variational framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic attack data. Its innovations include progressive training, a dual-path VAE-GAN architecture, and domain-specific feature matching to preserve the semantics of attacks. Evaluated on 100,000 net"
