  "summary": "This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different f..."
