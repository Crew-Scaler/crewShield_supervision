  "summary": "We introduce the eigen microstate entropy ($S_{\\text{EM}}$), a novel metric of complexity derived from the probabilities of statistically independent eigen microstates. After establishing its scaling behavior in equilibrium systems and demonstrating its utility in critical phenomena (mean spherical, Ising, and Potts models), we apply $S_{\\text{EM}}$ to non-equilibrium complex systems. Our analysis reveals a consistent precursor signal: a significant increase in $S_{\\text{EM}}$ precedes major pha..."
