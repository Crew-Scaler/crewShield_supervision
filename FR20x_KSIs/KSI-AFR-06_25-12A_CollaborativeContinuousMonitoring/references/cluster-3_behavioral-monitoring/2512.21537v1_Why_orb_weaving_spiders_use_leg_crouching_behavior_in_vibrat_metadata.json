  "summary": "Orb-weaving spiders primarily sense leg vibrations to detect and locate prey caught on their wheel-shaped webs. Biological experiments and computational modeling elucidated the physics of how these spiders use long-timescale web-building behaviors, which occur before prey capture, to modulate vibration sensing of prey by controlling web geometry, materials, and tension distribution. By contrast, the physics of how spiders use short-timescale leg behaviors to modulate vibration sensing on a web d..."
