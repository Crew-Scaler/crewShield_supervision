  "summary": "We discuss some aspects of stellar evolution in binary systems. While single stars can swell following the chemical evolution of their interior, stars belonging to binary systems cannot overflow the size of the Roche lobe and hydrostatic equilibrium is strictly impossible. The system is forced to exchange mass between its members through the inner Lagrangian point. In the first part of the paper, "
