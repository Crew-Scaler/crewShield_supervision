  "summary": "Road network data can provide rich information about cities and thus become the base for various urban research. However, processing large volume world-wide road network data requires intensive computing resources and the processed results might be different to be unified for testing downstream tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we process the OpenStreetMap data via a distributed computing of 5,000 cores on cloud services and release a structured world-wide 1-billion-vertex road network graph data..."
