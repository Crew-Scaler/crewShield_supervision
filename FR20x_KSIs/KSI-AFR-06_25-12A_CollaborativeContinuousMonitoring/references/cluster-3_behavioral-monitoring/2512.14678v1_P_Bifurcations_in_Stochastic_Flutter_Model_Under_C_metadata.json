  "summary": "Aeroelastic flutter represents a critical nonlinear instability in flight dynamics, where the coupling between structural elasticity and unsteady aerodynamics leads to self-excited oscillations. In deterministic settings, the onset of flutter is typically characterized by bifurcations of invariant sets such as equilibria or limit cycles. However, real flight conditions are inherently stochastic du"
