  "summary": "The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S., highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies such as hunting, fencing, use of repellents, and scare tactics. This underscores a critical need for intelligent, autonomous solutions capable of real-time deer detection and deterrence. But the progress in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the lack of a do..."
