  "summary": "We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Based on the predicted ..."
