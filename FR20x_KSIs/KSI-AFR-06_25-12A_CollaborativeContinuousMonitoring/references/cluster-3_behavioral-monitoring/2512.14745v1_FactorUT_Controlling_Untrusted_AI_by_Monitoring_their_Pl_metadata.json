  "summary": "As AI capabilities advance, we increasingly rely on powerful models to decompose complex tasks $\\unicode{x2013}$ but what if the decomposer itself is malicious? Factored cognition protocols decompose complex tasks into simpler child tasks: one model creates the decomposition, while other models implement the child tasks in isolation. Prior work uses trusted (weaker but reliable) models for decomposition, which limits usefulness for tasks where decomposition itself is challenging. We introduce Fa..."
