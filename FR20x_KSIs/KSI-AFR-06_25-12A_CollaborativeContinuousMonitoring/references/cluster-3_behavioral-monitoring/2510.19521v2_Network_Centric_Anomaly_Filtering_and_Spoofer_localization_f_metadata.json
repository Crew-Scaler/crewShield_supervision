  "summary": "This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection depends on UAV altitude and deployment density, and propose lightweight User Equipment (UE)-assisted appro..."
