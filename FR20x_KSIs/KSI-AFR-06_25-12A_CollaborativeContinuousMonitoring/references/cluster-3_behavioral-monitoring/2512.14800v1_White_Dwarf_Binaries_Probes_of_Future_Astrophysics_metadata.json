  "summary": "White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological di..."
