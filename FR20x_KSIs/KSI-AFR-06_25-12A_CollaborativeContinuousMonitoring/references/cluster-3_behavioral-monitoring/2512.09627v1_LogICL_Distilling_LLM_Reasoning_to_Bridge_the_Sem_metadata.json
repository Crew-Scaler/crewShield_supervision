  "summary": "Effective log anomaly detection is critical to sustaining reliability in large-scale IT infrastructures. Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to cap"
