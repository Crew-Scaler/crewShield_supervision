  "summary": "The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-d"
