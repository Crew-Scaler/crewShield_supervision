  "summary": "Active infrared thermography (AIRT) became a crucial tool in aerospace non-destructive testing (NDT), enabling the detection of hidden defects and anomalies in materials by capturing thermal responses over time. In AIRT, autoencoders are widely used to enhance defect detection by reducing the dimensionality of thermal data and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. However, traditional AIRT autoencoders often struggle to disentangle subtle defect features from dominant background responses, leadin..."
