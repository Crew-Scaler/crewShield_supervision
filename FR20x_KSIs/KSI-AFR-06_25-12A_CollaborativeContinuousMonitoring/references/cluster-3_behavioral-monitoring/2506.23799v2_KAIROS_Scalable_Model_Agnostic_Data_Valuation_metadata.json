  "summary": "Training data increasingly shapes not only model accuracy but also regulatory compliance and market valuation of AI assets. Yet existing valuation methods remain inadequate: model-based techniques depend on a single fitted model and inherit its biases, while algorithm-based approaches such as Data Shapley require costly retrainings at web scale. Recent Wasserstein-based model-agnostic methods rely"
