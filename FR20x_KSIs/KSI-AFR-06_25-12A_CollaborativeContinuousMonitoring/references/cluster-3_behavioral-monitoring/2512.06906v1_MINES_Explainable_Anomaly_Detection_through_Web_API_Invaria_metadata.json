  "summary": "Detecting the anomalies of web applications, important infrastructures for running modern companies and governments, is crucial for providing reliable web services. Many modern web applications operate on web APIs (e.g., RESTful, SOAP, and WebSockets), their exposure invites intended attacks or unintended illegal visits, causing abnormal system behaviors. However, such anomalies can share very similar logs with normal logs, missing crucial information (which could be in database) for log discrim..."
