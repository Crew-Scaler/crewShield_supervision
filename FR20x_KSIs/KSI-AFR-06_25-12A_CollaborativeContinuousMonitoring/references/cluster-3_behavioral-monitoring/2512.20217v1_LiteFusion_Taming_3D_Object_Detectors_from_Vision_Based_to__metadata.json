  "summary": "3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficul..."
