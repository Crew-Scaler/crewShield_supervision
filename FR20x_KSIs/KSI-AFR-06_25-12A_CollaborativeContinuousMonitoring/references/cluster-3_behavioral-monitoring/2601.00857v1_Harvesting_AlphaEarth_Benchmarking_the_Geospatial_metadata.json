  "summary": "Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations in existing featurization methods. More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experim"
