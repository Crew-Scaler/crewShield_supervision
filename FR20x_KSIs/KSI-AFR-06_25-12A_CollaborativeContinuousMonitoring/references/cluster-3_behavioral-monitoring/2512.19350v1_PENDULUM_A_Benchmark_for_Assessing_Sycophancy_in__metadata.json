  "summary": "Sycophancy, an excessive tendency of AI models to agree with user input at the expense of factual accuracy or in contradiction of visual evidence, poses a critical and underexplored challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While prior studies have examined this behavior in text-only settings of large language models, existing research on visual or multimodal counterparts remains lim"
