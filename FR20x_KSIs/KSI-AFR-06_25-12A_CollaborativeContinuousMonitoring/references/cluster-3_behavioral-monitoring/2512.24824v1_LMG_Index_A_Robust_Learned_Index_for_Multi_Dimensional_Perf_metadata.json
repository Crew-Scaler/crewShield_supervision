  "summary": "Index structures are fundamental for efficient query processing on large-scale datasets. Learned indexes model the indexing process as a prediction problem to overcome the inherent trade-offs of traditional indexes. However, most existing learned indexes optimize only for limited objectives like query latency or space usage, neglecting other practical evaluation dimensions such as update efficiency and stability. Moreover, many learned indexes rely on assumptions about data distributions or work..."
