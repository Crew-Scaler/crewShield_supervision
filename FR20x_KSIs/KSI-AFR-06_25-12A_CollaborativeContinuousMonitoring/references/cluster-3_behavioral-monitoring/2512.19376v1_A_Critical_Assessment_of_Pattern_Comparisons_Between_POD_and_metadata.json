  "summary": "Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decompositi..."
