  "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of neural networks, as it enables the identification of samples outside the training domain. We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication modul..."
