  "summary": "Be stars are rapidly rotating main-sequence (MS) stars that play a crucial role in understanding stellar evolution and binary interactions. In this letter, we propose a new formation scenario for black hole (BH) + Be star binaries (hereafter BHBe binaries), where the Be star is produced through the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLOF) mechanism. Our analysis is based on numerical simulations of the WRLOF process in massive binaries, building upon recent theoretical work. We demonstrate that the WRLO..."
