  "summary": "With the widespread adoption of Artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based tools and components are becoming omnipresent in today's solutions. However, these components and tools are posing a significant threat when it comes to adversarial attacks. Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that leverages the collective participation of workers and their smart devices to collect data. One of the "
