  "summary": "FinTechs increasing connectivity, rapid innovation, and reliance on global digital infrastructures present significant cybersecurity challenges. Traditional cybersecurity frameworks often struggle to identify and prioritize sector-specific vulnerabilities or adapt to evolving adversary tactics, particularly in highly targeted sectors such as FinTech. To address these gaps, we propose ISADM (Integrated STRIDE-ATTACK-D3FEND Threat Model), a novel hybrid methodology applied to FinTech security that..."
