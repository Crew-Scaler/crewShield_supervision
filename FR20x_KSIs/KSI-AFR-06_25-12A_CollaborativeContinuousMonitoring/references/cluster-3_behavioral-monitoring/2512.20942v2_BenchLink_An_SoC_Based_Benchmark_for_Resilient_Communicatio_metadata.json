  "summary": "Accurate timing and synchronization, typically enabled by GPS, are essential for modern wireless communication systems. However, many emerging applications must operate in GPS-denied environments where signals are unreliable or disrupted, resulting in oscillator drift and carrier frequency impairments. To address these challenges, we present BenchLink, a System-on-Chip (SoC)-based benchmark for resilient communication links that functions without GPS and supports adaptive pilot density and modul..."
