  "summary": "The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide a revolutionary measurement of the Universe's expansion kinematics, driven by dark matter and dark energy, out to $z \\approx 3$. The accuracy of this measurement is predicated on the assumption that standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities do not evolve with redshift. If present, SN Ia luminosity evolution is expected to be most detectable in the dark matter-dominated era of the Universe ($z \\gtrsim 1.5$), with its effects becoming mo..."
