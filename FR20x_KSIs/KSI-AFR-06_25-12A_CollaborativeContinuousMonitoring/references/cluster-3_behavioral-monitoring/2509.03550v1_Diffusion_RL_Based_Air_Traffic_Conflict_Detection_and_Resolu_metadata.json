  "summary": "In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a \"unimodal bias\" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic constraints, often resulting in \"decision deadlocks.\" To overcome this..."
