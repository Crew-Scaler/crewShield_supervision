  "summary": "Gathering enough images to train a deep computer vision model is a constant challenge. Unfortunately, collecting images from unknown sources can leave your model s behavior at risk of being manipulated by a dirty-label or clean-label attack unless the images are properly inspected. Manually inspecting each image-label pair is impractical and common poison-detection methods that involve re-training"
