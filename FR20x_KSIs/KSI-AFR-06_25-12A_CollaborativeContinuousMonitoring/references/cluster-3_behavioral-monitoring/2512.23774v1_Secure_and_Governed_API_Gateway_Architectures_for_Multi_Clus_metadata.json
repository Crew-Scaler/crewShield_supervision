  "summary": "API gateways serve as critical enforcement points for security, governance, and traffic management in cloud-native systems. As organizations increasingly adopt multi-cluster and hybrid cloud deployments, maintaining consistent policy enforcement, predictable performance, and operational stability across heterogeneous gateway environments becomes challenging. Existing approaches typically manage security, governance, and performance as loosely coupled concerns, leading to configuration drift, del..."
