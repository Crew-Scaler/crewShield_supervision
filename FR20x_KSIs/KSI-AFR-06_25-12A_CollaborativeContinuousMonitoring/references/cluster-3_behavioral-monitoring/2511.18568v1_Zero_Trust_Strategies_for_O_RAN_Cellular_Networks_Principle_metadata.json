  "summary": "Cellular networks have become foundational to modern communication, supporting a broad range of applications, from civilian use to enterprise systems and military tactical networks. The advent of fifth-generation and beyond cellular networks (B5G) introduces emerging compute capabilities into the Radio Access Network (RAN), transforming it from a traditionally closed, vendor-locked infrastructure into an open and programmable ecosystem. This evolution, exemplified by Open-RAN (O-RAN), enables th..."
