  "summary": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are used extensively in critical infrastructure, underscoring the need for anomaly detection systems that are able to catch even the most motivated attackers. Traditional anomaly detection techniques typically do `one-off' training on datasets crafted by experts or generated by fuzzers, potentially limiting their ability to generalize to unseen and more subtle attack strategies. Stopping at this point misses a key opportunity: a defender can actively challenge the a..."
