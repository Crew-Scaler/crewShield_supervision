  "summary": "The web continues to grow, but dependency-monitoring tools and standards for resource integrity lag behind. Currently, there exists no robust method to verify the integrity of web resources, much less in a generalizable yet performant manner, and supply chains remain one of the most targeted parts of the attack surface of web applications.\n  In this paper, we present the design of LiMS, a transparent system to bootstrap link integrity guarantees in web browsing sessions with minimal overhead.
