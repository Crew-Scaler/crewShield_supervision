  "summary": "Recent attacks on critical infrastructure, including the 2021 Oldsmar water treatment breach and 2023 Danish energy sector compromises, highlight urgent security gaps in Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. While Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative intrusion detection, existing frameworks remain vulnerable to Byzantine poisoning attacks and lack robust agent authenticati"
