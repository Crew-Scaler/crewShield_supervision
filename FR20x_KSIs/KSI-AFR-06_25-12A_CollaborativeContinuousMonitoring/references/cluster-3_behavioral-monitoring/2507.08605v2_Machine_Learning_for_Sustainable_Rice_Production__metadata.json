  "summary": "Rice cultivation supplies half the world's population with staple food, while also being a major driver of freshwater depletion--consuming roughly a quarter of global freshwater--and accounting for approx. 48% of greenhouse gas emissions from croplands. In regions like Punjab, India, where groundwater levels are plummeting at 41.6 cm/year, adopting water-saving rice farming practices is critical. "
