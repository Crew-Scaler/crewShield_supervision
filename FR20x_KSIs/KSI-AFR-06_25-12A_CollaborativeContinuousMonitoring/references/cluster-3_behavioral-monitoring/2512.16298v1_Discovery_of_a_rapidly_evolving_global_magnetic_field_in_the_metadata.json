  "summary": "We present a spectropolarimetric study of the nearby M4.5V exoplanet host star YZ Cet, based on near-infrared observations obtained with the SpectroPolarim\u00e8tre InfraRouge (SPIRou) at the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope. We detect striking changes in the large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry over the course of just a few stellar rotations, a level of short-term global magnetic field evolution rarely reported in M dwarfs. We modeled the temporal variation of the longitudinal magnetic f..."
