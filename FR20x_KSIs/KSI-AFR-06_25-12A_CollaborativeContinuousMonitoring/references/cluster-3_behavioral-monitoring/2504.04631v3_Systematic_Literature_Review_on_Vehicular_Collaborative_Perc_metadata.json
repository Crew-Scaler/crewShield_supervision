  "summary": "The effectiveness of autonomous vehicles relies on reliable perception capabilities. Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and sensor fusion technologies, current single-vehicle perception systems continue to encounter limitations, notably visual occlusions and limited long-range detection capabilities. Collaborative Perception (CP), enabled by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these i..."
