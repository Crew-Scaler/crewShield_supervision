  "summary": "We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains w..."
