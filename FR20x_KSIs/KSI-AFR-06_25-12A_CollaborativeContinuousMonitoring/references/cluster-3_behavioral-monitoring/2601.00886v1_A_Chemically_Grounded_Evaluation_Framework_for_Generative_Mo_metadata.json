  "summary": "Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machin..."
