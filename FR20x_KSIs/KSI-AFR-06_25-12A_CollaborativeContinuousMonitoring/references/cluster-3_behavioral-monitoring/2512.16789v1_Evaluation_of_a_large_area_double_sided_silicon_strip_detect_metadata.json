  "summary": "Designed to provide quality assurance for ion-beam radiotherapy, the prototype fIVI (filtered Interaction Vertex Imaging) Range Monitoring System is a two-layer tracker which employs double-sided strip-segmented silicon detectors. To meet the high demands of a clinical environment, a large sensitive area is required, along with a fast and compact readout. As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ signifi..."
