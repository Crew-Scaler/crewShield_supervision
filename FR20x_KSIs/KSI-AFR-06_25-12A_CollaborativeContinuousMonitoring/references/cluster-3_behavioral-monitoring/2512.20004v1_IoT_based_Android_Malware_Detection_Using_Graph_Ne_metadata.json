  "summary": "Since the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely adopted using Android applications, detecting malicious Android apps is essential. In recent years, Android graph-based deep learning research has proposed many approaches to extract relationships from applications as graphs to generate graph embeddings. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based classification using a Graph Neural Network ("
