  "summary": "We present STORM (Search-Guided Generative World Models), a novel framework for spatio-temporal reasoning in robotic manipulation that unifies diffusion-based action generation, conditional video prediction, and search-based planning. Unlike prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that rely on abstract latent dynamics or delegate reasoning to language components, STORM grounds planning in explic"
