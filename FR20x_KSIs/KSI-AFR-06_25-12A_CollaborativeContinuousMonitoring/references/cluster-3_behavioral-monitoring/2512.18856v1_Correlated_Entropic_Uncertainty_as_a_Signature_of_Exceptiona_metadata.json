  "summary": "Non-Hermitian physics has become a fundamental framework for understanding open systems where gain and loss play essential roles, with impact across photonics, quantum science, and condensed matter. While the role of complex eigenvalues is well established, the nature of the corresponding eigenfunctions has remained a long-standing problem. Here we show that it arises from a fundamental entropic uncertainty trade-off between phase entropy and its Fourier representation. This trade-off enforces a..."
