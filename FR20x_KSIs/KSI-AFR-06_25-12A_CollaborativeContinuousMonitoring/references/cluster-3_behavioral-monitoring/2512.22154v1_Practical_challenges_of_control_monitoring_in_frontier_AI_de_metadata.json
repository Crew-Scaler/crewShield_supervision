  "summary": "Automated control monitors could play an important role in overseeing highly capable AI agents that we do not fully trust. Prior work has explored control monitoring in simplified settings, but scaling monitoring to real-world deployments introduces additional dynamics: parallel agent instances, non-negligible oversight latency, incremental attacks between agent instances, and the difficulty of identifying scheming agents based on individual harmful actions. In this paper, we analyse design choi..."
