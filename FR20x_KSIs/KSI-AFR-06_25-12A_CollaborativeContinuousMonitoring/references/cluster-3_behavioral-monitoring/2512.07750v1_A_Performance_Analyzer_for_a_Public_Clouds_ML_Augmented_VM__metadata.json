  "summary": "Many operational cloud systems use one or more machine learning models that help them achieve better efficiency and performance. But operators do not have tools to help them understand how each model and the interaction between them affect the end-to-end system performance. SANJESH is such a tool. SANJESH supports a diverse set of performance-related queries which we answer through a bi-level optimization. We invent novel mechanisms to solve this optimization more quickly. These techniques allow..."
