  "summary": "Evolving attacks are a critical challenge for the long-term success of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The rise of these changing patterns has exposed the limitations of traditional network security methods. While signature-based methods are used to detect different types of attacks, they often fail to detect unknown attacks. Moreover, the system requires frequent updates with new sign"
