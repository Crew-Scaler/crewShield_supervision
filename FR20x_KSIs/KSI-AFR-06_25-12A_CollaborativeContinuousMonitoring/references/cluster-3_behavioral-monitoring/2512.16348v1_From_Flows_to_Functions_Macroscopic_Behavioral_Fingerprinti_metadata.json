  "summary": "Identifying devices such as cameras, printers, voice assistants, or health monitoring sensors, collectively known as the Internet of Things (IoT), within a network is a critical operational task, particularly to manage the cyber risks they introduce. While behavioral fingerprinting based on network traffic analysis has shown promise, most existing approaches rely on machine learning (ML) techniques applied to fine-grained features of short-lived traffic units (packets and/or flows). These method..."
