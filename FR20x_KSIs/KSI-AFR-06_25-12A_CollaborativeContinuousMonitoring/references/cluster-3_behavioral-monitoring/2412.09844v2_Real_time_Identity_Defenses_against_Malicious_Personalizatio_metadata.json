  "summary": "Personalized generative diffusion models, capable of synthesizing highly realistic images based on a few reference portraits, may pose substantial social, ethical, and legal risks via identity replication. Existing defense mechanisms rely on computationally intensive adversarial perturbations tailored to individual images, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. This study introduces the Real-time Identity Defender (RID), a neural network designed to generate adversarial perturbati..."
