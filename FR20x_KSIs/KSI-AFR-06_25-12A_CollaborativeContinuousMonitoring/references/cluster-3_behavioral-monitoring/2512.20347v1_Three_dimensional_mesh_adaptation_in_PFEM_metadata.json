  "summary": "Chaotic free surface flows are challenging problems to simulate numerically, mainly due to the significant changes in geometry and frequent topological changes. Methods that track the evolution of the fluid in a Lagrangian formulation are a natural choice. One such method is the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). As a hybrid particle-based and mesh-based method, PFEM leverages advantages from both approaches. The equations of motion are solved on a mesh using the finite element method and th..."
