  "summary": "We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission prediction, models were designed for 2-..."
