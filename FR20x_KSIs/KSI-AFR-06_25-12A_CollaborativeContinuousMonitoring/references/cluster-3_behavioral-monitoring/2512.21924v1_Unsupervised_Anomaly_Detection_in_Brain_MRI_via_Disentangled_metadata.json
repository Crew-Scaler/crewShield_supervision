  "summary": "Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs d..."
