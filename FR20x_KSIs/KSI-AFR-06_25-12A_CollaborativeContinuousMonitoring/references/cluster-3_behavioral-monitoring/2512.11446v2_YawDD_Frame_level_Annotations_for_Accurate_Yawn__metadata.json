  "summary": "Driver fatigue remains a leading cause of road accidents, with 24% of crashes involving drowsy drivers. While yawning serves as an early behavioral indicator of fatigue, existing machine learning approaches face significant challenges due to video-annotated datasets that introduce systematic noise from coarse temporal annotations. We develop a semi-automated labeling pipeline with human-in-the-loo"
