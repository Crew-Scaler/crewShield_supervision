  "summary": "Microquasars are radio-emitting X-ray binaries accompanied by relativistic jets. They are established sources of 100~TeV gamma rays and are considered promising candidates for cosmic-ray acceleration. Motivated by recent detections of $\\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical"
