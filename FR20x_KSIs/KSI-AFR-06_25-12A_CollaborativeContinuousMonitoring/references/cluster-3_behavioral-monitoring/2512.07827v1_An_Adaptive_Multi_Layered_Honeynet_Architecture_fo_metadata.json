  "summary": "The escalating sophistication and variety of cyber threats have rendered static honeypots inadequate, necessitating adaptive, intelligence-driven deception. In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution"
