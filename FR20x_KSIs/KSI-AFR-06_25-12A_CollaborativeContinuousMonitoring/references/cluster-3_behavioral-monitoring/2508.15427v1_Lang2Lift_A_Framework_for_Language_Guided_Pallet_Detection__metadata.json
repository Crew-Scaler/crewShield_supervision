  "summary": "The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and retrieving pallets under such conditions. We presen..."
