  "summary": "In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comp"
