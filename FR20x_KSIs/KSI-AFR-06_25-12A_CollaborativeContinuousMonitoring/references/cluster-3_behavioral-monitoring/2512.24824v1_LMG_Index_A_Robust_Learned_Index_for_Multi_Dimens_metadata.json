  "summary": "Index structures are fundamental for efficient query processing on large-scale datasets. Learned indexes model the indexing process as a prediction problem to overcome the inherent trade-offs of traditional indexes. However, most existing learned indexes optimize only for limited objectives like query latency or space usage, neglecting other practical evaluation dimensions such as update efficienc"
