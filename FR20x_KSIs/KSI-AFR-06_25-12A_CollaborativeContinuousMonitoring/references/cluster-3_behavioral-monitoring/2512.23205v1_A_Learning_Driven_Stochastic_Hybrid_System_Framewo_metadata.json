  "summary": "This paper presents a new learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (LSHS) framework designed for the detection and classification of contingencies in modern power systems. Unlike conventional monitoring schemes, the proposed approach is capable of identifying unobservable events that remain hidden from standard sensing infrastructures, such as undetected protection system malfunctions. The framewor"
