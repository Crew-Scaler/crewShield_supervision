  "summary": "PKS 0346-27 is a Low Synchrotron Peaked (LSP) blazar at redshift 0.991. The very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) spectra of blazars are always affected by $\u03b3\u03b3$ absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and subsequently, no blazars have been detected in VHE $\u03b3$-rays at redshifts exceeding 1. Extending the redshift range of VHE-detected blazars to $z \\gtrsim 1$ will yield insights into t"
