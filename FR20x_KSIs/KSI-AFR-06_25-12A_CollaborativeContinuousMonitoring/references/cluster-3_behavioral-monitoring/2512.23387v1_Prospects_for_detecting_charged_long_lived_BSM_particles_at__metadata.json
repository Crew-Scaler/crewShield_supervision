  "summary": "The search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider is expanding to include unconventional signatures such as long-lived particles. This mini-review assesses the prospects for detecting electrically charged long-lived particles using the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment. We synthesize findings from recent studies that evaluate sensitivity to supersymmetric models, radiative neutrino mass scenarios, and generic multiply charged objects. A key component of this review is the compar..."
