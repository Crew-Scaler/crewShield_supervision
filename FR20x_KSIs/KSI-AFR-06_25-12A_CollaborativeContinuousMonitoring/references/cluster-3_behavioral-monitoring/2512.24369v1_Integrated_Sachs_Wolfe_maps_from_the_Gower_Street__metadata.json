  "summary": "The late-time linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect directly probes the dynamics of cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark energy. Detecting these weak, secondary temperature anisotropy signals of the CMB requires accurate theoretical predictions of their amplitude across cosmological models. By extending the pyGenISW package, previously limited to $\u039b$CDM, we aim to generate full-sky ISW "
