  "summary": "Predictive maintenance demands accurate anomaly detection and trustable explanations. Although multimodal fusion of sensor time-series and thermal imagery shows promise, we demonstrate that naive fusion strategies can paradoxically degrade performance. This paper introduces a Cascaded Anomaly Detection framework that decouples detection and localization. Stage 1 employs an LSTM-based sensor encoder with temporal attention for high-accuracy detection, while Stage 2 activates a CNN-based thermal e..."
