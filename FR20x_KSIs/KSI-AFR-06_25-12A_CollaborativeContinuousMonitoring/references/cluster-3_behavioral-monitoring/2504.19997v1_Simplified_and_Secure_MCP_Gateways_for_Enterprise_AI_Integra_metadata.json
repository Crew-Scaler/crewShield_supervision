  "summary": "The increased adoption of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI Agents necessitates robust security for Enterprise integrations. This paper introduces the MCP Gateway to simplify self-hosted MCP server integration. The proposed architecture integrates security principles, authentication, intrusion detection, and secure tunneling, enabling secure self-hosting without exposing infrastructure. Key contributions include a reference architecture, threat model mapping, simplified integration strateg..."
