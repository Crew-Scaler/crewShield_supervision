  "summary": "This paper presents a holistic approach to attacker preference modeling from system-level audit logs using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adversary modeling is an important capability in cybersecurity that lets defenders characterize behaviors of potential attackers, which enables attribution to known cyber adversary groups. Existing approaches rely on documenting an ever-evolving set of attacker tools and techniques to track known threat actors. Although attacks evolve constantly, attack..."
