  "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes applications, from self-driving cars to biometric authentication. However, their unpredictable and unreliable behaviors in real-world settings require new approaches to characterize and ensure their reliability.\n  This paper introduces DeepProv, a novel and customizable system designed to capture and characterize the runtim"
