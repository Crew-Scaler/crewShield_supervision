  "summary": "Gravitational wave echoes offer a unique probe of the near-horizon structure of astrophysical black holes, beyond the standard ''black hole spectroscopy''. Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interi"
