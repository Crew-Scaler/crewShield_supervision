  "summary": "As machine learning (ML) becomes an integral part of high-autonomy systems, it is critical to ensure the trustworthiness of learning-enabled software systems (LESS). Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's"
