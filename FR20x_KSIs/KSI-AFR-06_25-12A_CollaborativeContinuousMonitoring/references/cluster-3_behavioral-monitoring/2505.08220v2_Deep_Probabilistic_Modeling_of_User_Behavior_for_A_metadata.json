  "summary": "To improve the identification of potential anomaly patterns in complex user behavior, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on a deep mixture density network. The method constructs a Gaussian mixture model parameterized by a neural network, enabling conditional probability modeling of user behavior. It effectively captures the multimodal distribution characteristics commonly presen"
