  "summary": "This paper presents a decentralized methodology for detecting and mitigating flapping phenomena in power systems, primarily caused by the operation of discrete devices. The proposed approach applies moving-window autocorrelation to local measurements, enabling each device to autonomously identify sustained oscillations. Upon detection, a probabilistic, device-specific mitigation strategy is executed. Flexible demand resources (DFRs), under-load tap changers (ULTCs), and automatic voltage regulat..."
