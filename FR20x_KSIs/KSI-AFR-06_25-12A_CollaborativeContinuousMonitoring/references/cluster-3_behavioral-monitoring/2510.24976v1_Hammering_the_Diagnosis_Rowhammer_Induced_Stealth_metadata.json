  "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful architectures in medical image analysis, excelling in tasks such as disease detection, segmentation, and classification. However, their reliance on large, attention-driven models makes them vulnerable to hardware-level attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel threat model referred to as Med-Hammer that combines the Rowhammer hardware fault inje"
