  "summary": "Battery recycling is becoming increasingly critical due to the rapid growth in battery usage and the limited availability of natural resources. Moreover, as battery energy densities continue to rise, improper handling during recycling poses significant safety hazards, including potential fires at recycling facilities. Numerous systems have been proposed for battery detection and removal from WEEE recycling lines, including X-ray and RGB-based visual inspection methods, typically driven by AI-pow..."
