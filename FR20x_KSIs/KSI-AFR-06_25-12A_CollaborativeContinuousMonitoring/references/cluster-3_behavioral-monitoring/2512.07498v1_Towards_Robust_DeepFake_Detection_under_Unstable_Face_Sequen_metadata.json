  "summary": "Ensuring the authenticity of video content remains challenging as DeepFake generation becomes increasingly realistic and robust against detection. Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized G..."
