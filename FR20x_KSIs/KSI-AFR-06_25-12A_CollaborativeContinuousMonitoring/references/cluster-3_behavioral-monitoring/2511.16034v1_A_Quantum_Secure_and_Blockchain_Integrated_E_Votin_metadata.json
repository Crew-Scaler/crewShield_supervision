  "summary": "The rapid growth of quantum computing poses a threat to the cryptographic foundations of digital systems, requiring the development of secure and scalable electronic voting (evoting) frameworks. We introduce a post-quantum-secure evoting architecture that integrates Falcon lattice-based digital signatures, biometric authentication via MobileNetV3 and AdaFace, and a permissioned blockchain for tamp"
