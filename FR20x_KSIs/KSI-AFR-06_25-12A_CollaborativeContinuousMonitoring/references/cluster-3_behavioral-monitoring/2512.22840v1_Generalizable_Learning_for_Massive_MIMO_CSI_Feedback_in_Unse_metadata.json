  "summary": "Deep learning is promising to enhance the accuracy and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback, which can boost the capacity of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Nevertheless, the generalizability of current deep learning-based CSI feedback algorithms cannot be guaranteed in unseen environments, which induces a high deployment cost. In this paper, the generalizability of deep learning-based CSI feedback is promoted with..."
