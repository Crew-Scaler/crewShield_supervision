  "summary": "Simulating nonlinear reaction-diffusion dynamics on complex, non-Euclidean manifolds remains a fundamental challenge in computational morphogenesis, constrained by high-fidelity mesh generation costs and symplectic drift in discrete time-stepping schemes. This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves "
