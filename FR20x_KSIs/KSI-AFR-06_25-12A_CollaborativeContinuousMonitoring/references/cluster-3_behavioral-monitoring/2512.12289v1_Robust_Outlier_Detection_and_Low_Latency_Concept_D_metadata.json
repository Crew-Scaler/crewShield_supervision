  "summary": "Outlier detection and concept drift detection represent two challenges in data analysis. Most studies address these issues separately. However, joint detection mechanisms in regression remain underexplored, where the continuous nature of output spaces makes distinguishing drifts from outliers inherently challenging. To address this, we propose a novel robust regression framework for joint outlier "
