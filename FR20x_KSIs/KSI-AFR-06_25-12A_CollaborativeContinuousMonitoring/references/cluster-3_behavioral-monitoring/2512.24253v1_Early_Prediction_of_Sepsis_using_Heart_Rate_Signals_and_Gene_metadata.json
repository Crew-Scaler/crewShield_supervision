  "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning al..."
