  "summary": "Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is critical for maintaining the reliability and availability of large-scale online service systems. While machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)-based methods have advanced the LogAD, they often suffer from limited interpretability, high inference costs, and extensive preprocessing requirements, limiting their practicality for real-time, high-volume log analysis. In contrast, rule-based systems offer efficiency and transparency, but ..."
