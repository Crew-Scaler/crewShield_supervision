  "summary": "Compiler-based Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) offers strong forward-edge protection but remains challenging to deploy in large C/C++ software due to visibility mismatches, type inconsistencies, and unintended behavioral failures. We present CFIghter, the first fully automated system that enables strict, type-based CFI in real-world projects by detecting, classifying, and repairing unintended policy "
