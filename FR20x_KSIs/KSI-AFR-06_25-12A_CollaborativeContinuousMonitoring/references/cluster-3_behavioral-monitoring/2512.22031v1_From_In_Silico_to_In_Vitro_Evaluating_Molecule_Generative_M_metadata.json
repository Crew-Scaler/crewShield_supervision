  "summary": "Hit identification is a critical yet resource-intensive step in the drug discovery pipeline, traditionally relying on high-throughput screening of large compound libraries. Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipel..."
