  "summary": "We formulate the covariant hydrodynamics equations describing the fluid dynamics as the problem of intersection theory on the infinite dimensional symplectic manifold associated with spacetime. This point of view separates the structures related to the equation of state, the geometry of spacetime, and structures related to the (differential) topology of spacetime. We point out a five-dimensional origin of the formalism of Lichnerowicz and Carter. Our formalism also incorporates the chiral anomal..."
