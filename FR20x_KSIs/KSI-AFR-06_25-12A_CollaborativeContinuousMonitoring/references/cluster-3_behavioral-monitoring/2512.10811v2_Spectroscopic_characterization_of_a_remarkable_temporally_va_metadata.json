  "summary": "Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection metho..."
