  "summary": "Although AI-based models have achieved high accuracy in IoT threat detection, their deployment in enterprise environments is constrained by reliance on stationary datasets that fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world IoT NetFlow traffic, which is frequently affected by concept drift. Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scal..."
