  "summary": "Malicious Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) present a significant threat to next-generation networks (NGNs), posing risks such as unauthorized surveillance, data theft, and the delivery of hazardous materials. This paper proposes an integrated (AE)-classifier system to detect malicious UAVs. The proposed AE, based on a 4-layer Tri-orientated Spatial Mamba (TSMamba) architecture, effectively captures"
