  "summary": "The proliferation of cloud-integrated IoT systems has intensified exposure to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks due to the expanded attack surface, heterogeneous device behaviors, and limited edge protection. However, DDoS detection in this context remains challenging because of complex traffic dynamics, severe class imbalance, and scarce labeled data. While recent methods have explored solutions to address class imbalance, many still struggle to generalize under limited supervision a..."
