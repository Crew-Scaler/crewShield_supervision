  "summary": "With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature extraction method, which combines the natural ..."
