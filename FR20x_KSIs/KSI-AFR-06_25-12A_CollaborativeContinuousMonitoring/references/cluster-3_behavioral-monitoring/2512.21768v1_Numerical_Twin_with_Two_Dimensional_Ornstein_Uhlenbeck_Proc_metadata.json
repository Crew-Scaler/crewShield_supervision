  "summary": "Stochastic burst-like oscillations are common in physiological signals, yet there are few compact generative models that capture their transient structure. We propose a numerical-twin framework that represents transient narrowband activity as a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with three interpretable parameters: decay rate, mean frequency, and noise amplitude. We develop two complementary estimation strategies. The first fits the power spectral density, amplitude distribution, an..."
