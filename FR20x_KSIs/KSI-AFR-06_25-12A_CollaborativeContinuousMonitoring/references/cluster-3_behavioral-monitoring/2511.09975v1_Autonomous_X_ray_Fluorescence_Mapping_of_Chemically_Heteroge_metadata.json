  "summary": "We present X-AutoMap, a modular framework for autonomous X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping that enables chemically informed targeting of regions of interest through a correlative feature detection strategy. The system integrates classical computer vision and rule-based logic to identify features based on spatial relationships across multiple elemental maps, rather than relying solely on intensity or morphology. Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Na..."
