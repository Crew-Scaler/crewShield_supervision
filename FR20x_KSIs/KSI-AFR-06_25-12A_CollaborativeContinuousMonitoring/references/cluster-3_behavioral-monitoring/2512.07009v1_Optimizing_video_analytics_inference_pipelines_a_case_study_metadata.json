  "summary": "Cost-effective and scalable video analytics are essential for precision livestock monitoring, where high-resolution footage and near-real-time monitoring needs from commercial farms generates substantial computational workloads. This paper presents a comprehensive case study on optimizing a poultry welfare monitoring system through system-level improvements across detection, tracking, clustering, and behavioral analysis modules. We introduce a set of optimizations, including multi-level parallel..."
