  "summary": "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperation is reshaping traffic safety from an ego-centric sensing problem into one of collective intelligence. This survey structures recent progress within a unified Sensor-Perception-Decision (SPD) framework that formalizes how safety emerges from the interaction of distributed sensing, cooperative perception, and coordinated decision-making across vehicles and infr"
