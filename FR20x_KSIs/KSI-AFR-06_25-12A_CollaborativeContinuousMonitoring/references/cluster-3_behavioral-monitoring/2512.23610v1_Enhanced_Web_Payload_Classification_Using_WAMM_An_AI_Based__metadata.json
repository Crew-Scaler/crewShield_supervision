  "summary": "Web applications increasingly face evasive and polymorphic attack payloads, yet traditional web application firewalls (WAFs) based on static rule sets such as the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) often miss obfuscated or zero-day patterns without extensive manual tuning. This work introduces WAMM, an AI-driven multiclass web attack detection framework designed to reveal the limitations of rule-based systems by reclassifying HTTP requests into OWASP-aligned categories for a specific technology stack.
