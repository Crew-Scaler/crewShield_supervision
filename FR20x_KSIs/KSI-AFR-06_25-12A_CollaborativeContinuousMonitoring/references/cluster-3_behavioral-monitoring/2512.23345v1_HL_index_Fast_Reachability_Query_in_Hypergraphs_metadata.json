  "summary": "Reachability in hypergraphs is essential for modeling complex groupwise interactions in real-world applications such as co-authorship, social network, and biological analysis, where relationships go beyond pairwise interactions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of s-reachability, where two vertices are s-reachable if there exists a sequence of hyperedges (i.e., a walk) connecting them, such "
