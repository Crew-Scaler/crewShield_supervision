  "summary": "With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the original behav"
