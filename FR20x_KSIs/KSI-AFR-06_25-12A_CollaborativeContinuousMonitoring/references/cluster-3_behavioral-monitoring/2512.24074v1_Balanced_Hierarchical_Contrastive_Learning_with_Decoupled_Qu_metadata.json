  "summary": "Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling s..."
