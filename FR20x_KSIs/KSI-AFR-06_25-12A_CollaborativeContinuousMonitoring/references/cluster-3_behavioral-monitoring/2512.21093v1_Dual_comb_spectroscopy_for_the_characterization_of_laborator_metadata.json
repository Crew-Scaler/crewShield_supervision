  "summary": "Optical spectroscopy, in particular dual-comb (DC) spectroscopy, is a critical, non-invasive tool for combustion diagnostics, offering high precision and calibration-free advantages. However, its implementation remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared region. This work presents the development of a robust DC spectroscopic system based on electro-optical (EO) frequency comb generators and difference frequency generation (DFG), specifically designed for the characterization of laborator..."
