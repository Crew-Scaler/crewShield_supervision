  "summary": "This paper presents an applied AI pipeline for realtime geolocation from noisy microblog streams, unifying statistical hashtag segmentation, part-of-speech-driven proper-noun detection, dependency parsing around disaster lexicons, lightweight named-entity recognition, and gazetteer-grounded disambiguation to infer locations directly from text rather than sparse geotags. The approach operationalizes information extraction under streaming constraints, emphasizing low-latency NLP components and eff..."
