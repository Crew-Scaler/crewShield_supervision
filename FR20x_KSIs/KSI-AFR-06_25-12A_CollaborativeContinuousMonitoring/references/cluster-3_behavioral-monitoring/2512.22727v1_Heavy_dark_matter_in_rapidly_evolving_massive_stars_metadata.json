  "summary": "We study the impact of heavy dark matter (DM) captured in massive stars via scattering(s) with the star constituents. We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a d..."
