  "summary": "In this paper, we present a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) system for low-background beta radiation measurements. The system consists of a TPC with two-dimensional-strip readout Micromegas and an anti-coincidence detector with readout pads for cosmic ray veto. The detector system utilize an AGET-based waveform sampling system for data acquisition.\n  The beta detection capability of the system was verified through experimental test using $^{90}$Sr beta source. Additionally, a dedicated simulation ..."
