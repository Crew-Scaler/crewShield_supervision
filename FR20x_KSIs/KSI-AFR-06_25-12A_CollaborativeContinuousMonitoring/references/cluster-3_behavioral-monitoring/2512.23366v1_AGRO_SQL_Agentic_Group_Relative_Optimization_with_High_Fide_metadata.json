  "summary": "The advancement of Text-to-SQL systems is currently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality training data and the limited reasoning capabilities of models in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that addresses these issues through a dual-centric approach. From a Data-Centric perspective, we construct an iterative data factory that synthesizes RL-ready data characterized by high correctness and precise semantic-logic alignment, ensured by strict verification. From a ..."
