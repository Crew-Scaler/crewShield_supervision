  "summary": "Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR), are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic representations, which rely o..."
