  "summary": "Context. With CAPOS, we can mitigate the observational difficulties limiting access to bulge globular clusters in the optical and investigate them in more detail in the near-IR. Aims. To perform a rigorous abundance analysis of the metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6304, in order to determine its detailed chemical composition and identify multiple populations. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-IR spectra of 27 giant members. The abundances of 17 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, ..."
