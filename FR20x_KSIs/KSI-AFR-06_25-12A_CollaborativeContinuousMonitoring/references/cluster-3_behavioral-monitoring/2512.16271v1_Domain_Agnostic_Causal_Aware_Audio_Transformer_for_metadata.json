  "summary": "Accurate and interpretable classification of infant cry paralinguistics is essential for early detection of neonatal distress and clinical decision support. However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Caus"
