  "summary": "Parameter-efficient continual learning has emerged as a promising approach for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRA"
