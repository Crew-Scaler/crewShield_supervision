  "summary": "Imitation learning has shown promise in learning from large-scale real-world datasets. However, pretrained policies usually perform poorly without sufficient in-domain data. Besides, human-collected demonstrations entail substantial labour and tend to encompass mixed-quality data and redundant information. As a workaround, human-in-the-loop systems gather domain-specific data for policy post-training, and exploit closed-loop policy feedback to offer informative guidance, but usually require full..."
