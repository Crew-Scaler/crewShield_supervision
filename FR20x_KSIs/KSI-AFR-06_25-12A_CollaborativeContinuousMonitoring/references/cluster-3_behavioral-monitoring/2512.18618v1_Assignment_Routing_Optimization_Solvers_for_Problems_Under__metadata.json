  "summary": "We study the Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) problem in which items must be assigned one-to-one to placeholders while simultaneously determining a Hamiltonian cycle visiting all nodes exactly once. Extending previous exact MIP solvers with Gurobi and cutting-plane subtour elimination, we develop a solver tailored for practical packaging-planning scenarios with richer constraints.These include multiple placeholder options, time-frame restrictions, and multi-class item packaging. Experiments on 46 ..."
