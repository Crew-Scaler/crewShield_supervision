  "summary": "The deployment of multi-agent systems in dynamic, adversarial environments like robotic soccer necessitates real-time decision-making, sophisticated cooperation, and scalable algorithms to avoid the curse of dimensionality. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework, existing methods often struggle with the multi-granularity of tasks (long-term strategy vs. instant actions) and the complexity of large-scale agent interactions. This paper presents a unified Multi-Agent Reinfor..."
