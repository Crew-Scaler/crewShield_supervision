  "summary": "The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is reshaping telecommunications by promoting openness, flexibility, and intelligent closed-loop optimization. By decoupling hardware and software and enabling multi-vendor deployments, O-RAN reduces costs, enhances performance, and allows rapid adaptation to new technologies. A key innovation is intelligent network slicing, which partitions networ"
