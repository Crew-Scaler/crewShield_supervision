  "summary": "To safeguard Civilian Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) external information available to the platform encompassing the GNSS receiver can be used to detect attacks. Cross-checking the GNSS-provided time against alternative multiple trusted time sources can lead to attack detection aiming at controlling the GNSS receiver time. Leveraging external, network-connected secure time providers and onboard clock references, we achieve detection even under fine-grained time attacks. We provide an..."
