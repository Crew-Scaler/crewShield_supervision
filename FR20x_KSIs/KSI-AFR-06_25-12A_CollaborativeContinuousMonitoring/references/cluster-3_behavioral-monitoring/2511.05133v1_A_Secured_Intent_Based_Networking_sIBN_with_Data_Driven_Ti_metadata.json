  "summary": "While Intent-Based Networking (IBN) promises operational efficiency through autonomous and abstraction-driven network management, a critical unaddressed issue lies in IBN's implicit trust in the integrity of intent ingested by the network. This inherent assumption of data reliability creates a blind spot exploitable by Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an adversary intercepts and alters intent before it is enacted, compelling the network to orchestrate malicious configurations. This study ..."
