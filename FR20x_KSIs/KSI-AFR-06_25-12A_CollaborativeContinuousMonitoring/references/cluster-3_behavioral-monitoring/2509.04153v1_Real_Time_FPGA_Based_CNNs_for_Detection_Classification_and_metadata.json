  "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advances in deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection, classification, and tracking on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). With the increasing demand for real-time computer vision applications in domains such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance, FPGAs have emerged as a powerful alternative to GPUs and ASICs due to their reconfigurability, low power consumption, and deterministic latency. We critical..."
