  "summary": "Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it ..."
