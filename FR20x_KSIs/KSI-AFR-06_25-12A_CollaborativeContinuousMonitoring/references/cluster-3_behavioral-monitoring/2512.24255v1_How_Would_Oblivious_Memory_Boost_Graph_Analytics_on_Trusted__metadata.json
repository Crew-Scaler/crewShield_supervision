  "summary": "Trusted processors provide a way to perform joint computations while preserving data privacy. To overcome the performance degradation caused by data-oblivious algorithms to prevent information leakage, we explore the benefits of oblivious memory (OM) integrated in processors, to which the accesses are unobservable by adversaries. We focus on graph analytics, an important application vulnerable to access-pattern attacks. With a co-design between storage structure and algorithms, our prototype sys..."
