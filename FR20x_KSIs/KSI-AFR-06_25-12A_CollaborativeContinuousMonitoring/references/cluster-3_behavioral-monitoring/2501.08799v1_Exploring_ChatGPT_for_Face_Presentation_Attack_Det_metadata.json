  "summary": "This study highlights the potential of ChatGPT (specifically GPT-4o) as a competitive alternative for Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), outperforming several PAD models, including commercial solutions, in specific scenarios. Our results show that GPT-4o demonstrates high consistency, particularly in few-shot in-context learning, where its performance improves as more examples are provided "
