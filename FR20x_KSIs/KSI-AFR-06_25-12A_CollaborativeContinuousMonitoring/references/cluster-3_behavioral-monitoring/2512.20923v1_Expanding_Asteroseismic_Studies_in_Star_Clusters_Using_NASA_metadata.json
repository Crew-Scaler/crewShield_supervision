  "summary": "Star clusters have long been central to the study of stellar evolution due to their chemically and chronologically homogeneous populations. Asteroseismology, the analysis of stellar oscillations and pulsations, provides precise information about properties such as masses, radii, and ages of stars in the field. However, these stars lack calibration to an absolute scale, and so this project seeks to utilize the data from NASA's TESS mission and ESA's Gaia mission to identify additional cluster sta..."
