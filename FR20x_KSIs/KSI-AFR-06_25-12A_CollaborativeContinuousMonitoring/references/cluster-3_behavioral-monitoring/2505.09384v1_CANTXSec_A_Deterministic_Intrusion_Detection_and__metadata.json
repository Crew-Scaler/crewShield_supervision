  "summary": "Despite being a legacy protocol with various known security issues, Controller Area Network (CAN) still represents the de-facto standard for communications within vehicles, ships, and industrial control systems. Many research works have designed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to identify attacks by training machine learning classifiers on bus traffic or its properties. Actions to take after de"
