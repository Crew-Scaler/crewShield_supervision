  "summary": "Stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) formed in globular clusters (GCs) are promising sources for multiband gravitational wave (GW) observations, particularly with low- and middle-frequency detectors. These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constra..."
