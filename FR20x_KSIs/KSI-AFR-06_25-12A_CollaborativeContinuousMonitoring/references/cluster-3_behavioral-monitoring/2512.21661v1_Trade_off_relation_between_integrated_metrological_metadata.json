  "summary": "Quantum metrology plays a central role in precision sensing, where quantum enhancement of detection performance is crucial for both fundamental studies and practical applications. In this work, we derive a tight performance bound for magnetic-field sensing with a spin ensemble in the presence of dissipation. The metrological performance is quantified by the integrated metrological gain (IMG), whic"
