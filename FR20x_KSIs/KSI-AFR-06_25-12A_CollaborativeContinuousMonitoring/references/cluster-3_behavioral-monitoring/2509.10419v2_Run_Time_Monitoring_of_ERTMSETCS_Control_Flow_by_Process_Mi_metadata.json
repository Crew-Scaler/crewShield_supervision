  "summary": "Ensuring the resilience of computer-based railways is increasingly crucial to account for uncertainties and changes due to the growing complexity and criticality of those systems. Although their software relies on strict verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scen..."
