  "summary": "Modern cloud applications delivering global services are often built on distributed systems with a microservice architecture. In such systems, end-to-end user requests traverse multiple different services and machines, exhibiting intricate interactions. Consequently, cloud service systems are vulnerable to concurrency bugs, which pose significant challenges to their reliability. Existing methods f"
