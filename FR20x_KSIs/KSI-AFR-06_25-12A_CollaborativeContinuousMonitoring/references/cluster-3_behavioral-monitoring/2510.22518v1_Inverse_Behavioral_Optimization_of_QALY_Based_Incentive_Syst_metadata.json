  "summary": "This study introduces an inverse behavioral optimization framework that integrates QALY-based health outcomes, ROI-driven incentives, and adaptive behavioral learning to quantify how policy design shapes national healthcare performance. Building on the FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning) paradigm, the model embeds a regret-minimizing behavioral weighting mechanism that enables dynamic learning from heterogeneous policy environments. It recovers latent behavior..."
