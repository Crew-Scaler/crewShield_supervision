  "summary": "Embodied agents operating in open environments must translate high-level instructions into grounded, executable behaviors, often requiring coordinated use of both hands. While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planni..."
