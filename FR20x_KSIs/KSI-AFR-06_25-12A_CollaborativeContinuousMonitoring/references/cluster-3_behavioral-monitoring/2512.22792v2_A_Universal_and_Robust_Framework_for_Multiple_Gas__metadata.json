  "summary": "Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face two interconnected challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shift caused by signal drift and decision boundary failure induced by unknown gas interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance or conventional classifiers, failing to account for anisotropic feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. T"
