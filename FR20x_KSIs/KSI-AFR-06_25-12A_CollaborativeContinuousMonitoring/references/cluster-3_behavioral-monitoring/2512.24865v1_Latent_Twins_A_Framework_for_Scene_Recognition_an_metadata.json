  "summary": "The FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) mission will provide, for the first time, systematic far-infrared spectral measurements of Earth's outgoing radiation, enabling improved understanding of atmospheric processes and the radiation budget. Retrieving atmospheric states from these observations constitutes a high-dimensional, ill-posed inverse problem, particularly"
