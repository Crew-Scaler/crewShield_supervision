  "summary": "Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability"
