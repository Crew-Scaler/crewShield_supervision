  "summary": "Wearable and implantable healthcare sensors are pivotal for real-time patient monitoring but face critical challenges in power efficiency, data security, and signal noise. This paper introduces a novel platform that leverages hardware noise as a dual-purpose resource to enhance machine learning (ML) robustness and secure data via Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). By integrating noise-driven si"
