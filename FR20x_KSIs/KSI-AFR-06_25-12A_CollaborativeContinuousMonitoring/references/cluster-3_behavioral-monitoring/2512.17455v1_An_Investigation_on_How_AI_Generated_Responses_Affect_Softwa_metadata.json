  "summary": "Survey research is a fundamental empirical method in software engineering, enabling the systematic collection of data on professional practices, perceptions, and experiences. However, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new risks to survey integrity, as participants can use generative tools to fabricate or manipulate their responses. This study explores how LLMs are being misused in software engineering surveys and investigates the methodological implications of such ..."
