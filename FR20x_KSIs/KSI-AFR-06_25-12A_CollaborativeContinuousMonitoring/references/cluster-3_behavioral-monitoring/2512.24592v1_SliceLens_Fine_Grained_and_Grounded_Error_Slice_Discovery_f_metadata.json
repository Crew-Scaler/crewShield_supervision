  "summary": "Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approa..."
