  "summary": "We consider outdoor optical access points (OAPs), which, enabled by recent advances in metasurface technology, have attracted growing interest. While OAPs promise high data rates and strong physical-layer security, practical deployments still expose vulnerabilities and misuse patterns that necessitate a dedicated monitoring layer - the focus of this work. We therefore propose a user positioning an"
