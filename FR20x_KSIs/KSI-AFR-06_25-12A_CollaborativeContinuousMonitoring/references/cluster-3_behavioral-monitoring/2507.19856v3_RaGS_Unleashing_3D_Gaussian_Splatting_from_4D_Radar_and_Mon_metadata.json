  "summary": "4D millimeter-wave radar is a promising sensing modality for autonomous driving, yet effective 3D object detection from 4D radar and monocular images remains challenging. Existing fusion approaches either rely on instance proposals lacking global context or dense BEV grids constrained by rigid structures, lacking a flexible and adaptive representation for diverse scenes. To address this, we propose RaGS, the first framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) to fuse 4D radar and monocular..."
