  "summary": "Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM) for a sample's true-class ({\\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s), that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize that in "
