  "summary": "Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in many fields like fault diagnosis, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where critical information is often masked by noise and interference, making feature identification difficult. Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicat"
