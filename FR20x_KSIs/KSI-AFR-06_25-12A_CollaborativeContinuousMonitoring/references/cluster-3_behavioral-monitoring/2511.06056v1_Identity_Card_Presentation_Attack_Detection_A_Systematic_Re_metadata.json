  "summary": "Remote identity verification is essential for modern digital security; however, it remains highly vulnerable to sophisticated Presentation Attacks (PAs) that utilise forged or manipulated identity documents. Although Deep Learning (DL) has driven advances in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), the field is fundamentally limited by a lack of data and the poor generalisation of models across various document types and new attack methods.\n  This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR..."
