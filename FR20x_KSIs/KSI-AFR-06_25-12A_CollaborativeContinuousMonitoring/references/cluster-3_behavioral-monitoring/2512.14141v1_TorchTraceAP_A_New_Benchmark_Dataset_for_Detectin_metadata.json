  "summary": "Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely "
