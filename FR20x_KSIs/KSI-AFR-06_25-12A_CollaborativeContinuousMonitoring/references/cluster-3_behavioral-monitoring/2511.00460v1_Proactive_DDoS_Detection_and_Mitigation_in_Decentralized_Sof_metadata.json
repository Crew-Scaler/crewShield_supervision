  "summary": "Centralized Software-Defined Networking (cSDN) offers flexible and programmable control of networks but suffers from scalability and reliability issues due to its reliance on centralized controllers. Decentralized SDN (dSDN) alleviates these concerns by distributing control across multiple local controllers, yet this architecture remains highly vulnerable to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel detection and mitigation framework tailored for dSDN enviro..."
