  "summary": "Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates dynamic reward shaping,"
