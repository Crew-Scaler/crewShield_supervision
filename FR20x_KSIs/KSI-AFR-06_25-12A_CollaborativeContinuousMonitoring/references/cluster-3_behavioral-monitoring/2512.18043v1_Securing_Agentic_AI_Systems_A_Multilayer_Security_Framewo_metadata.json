  "summary": "Securing Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems requires addressing the complex cyber risks introduced by autonomous, decision-making, and adaptive behaviors. Agentic AI systems are increasingly deployed across industries, organizations, and critical sectors such as cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. However, their autonomy introduces unique security challenges, including unauthorized actions, adversarial manipulation, and dynamic environmental interactions. Existing AI security frame..."
