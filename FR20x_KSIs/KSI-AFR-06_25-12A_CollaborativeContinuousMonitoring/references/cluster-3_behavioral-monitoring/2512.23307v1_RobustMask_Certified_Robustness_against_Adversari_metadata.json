  "summary": "Neural ranking models have achieved remarkable progress and are now widely deployed in real-world applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, like other neural architectures, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations: subtle character-, word-, or phrase-level perturbations can poison retrieval results and artificially promote targeted candidates, undermining the i"
