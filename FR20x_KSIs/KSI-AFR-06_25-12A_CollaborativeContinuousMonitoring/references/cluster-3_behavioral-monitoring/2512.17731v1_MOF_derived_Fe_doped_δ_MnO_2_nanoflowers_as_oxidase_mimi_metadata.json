  "summary": "Structure and morphology play a crucial role in enhancing the biomimetic oxidase activity of nanozymes. In this study, a facile \\emph{in situ} chemical oxidation strategy was employed to synthesize MOF-derived MnO$_x$, utilizing the structural features of the parent MOF to enhance oxidase-mimicking activity. We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was ev..."
