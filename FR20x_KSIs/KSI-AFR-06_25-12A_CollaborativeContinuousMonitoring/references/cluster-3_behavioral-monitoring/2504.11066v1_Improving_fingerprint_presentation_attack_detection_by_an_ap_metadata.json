  "summary": "Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) systems are usually designed independently of the fingerprint verification system. While this can be acceptable for use cases where specific user templates are not predetermined, it represents a missed opportunity to enhance security in scenarios where integrating PAD with the fingerprint verification system could significantly leverage users' templates, which are the real target of a potential presentation attack. This does not mean that a PAD should be speci..."
