  "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data, but model weight distortion remains a major challenge in resource constrained IoT networks. In multi tier Federated IoT (Fed-IoT) systems, unstable connectivity and adversarial interference can silently alter transmitted parameters, degrading convergence. We propose DP-EMAR, a differentially private, error model based autonomous repair framework that detects and reconstructs transmission induced distortions du..."
