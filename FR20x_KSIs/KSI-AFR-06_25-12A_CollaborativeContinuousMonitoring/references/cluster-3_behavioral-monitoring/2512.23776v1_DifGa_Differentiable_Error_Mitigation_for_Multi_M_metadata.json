  "summary": "We introduce DifGa, a fully differentiable error-mitigation framework for continuous-variable (CV) quantum photonic circuits operating under Gaussian loss and weak non-Gaussian noise. The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the default.gaussian backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differen"
