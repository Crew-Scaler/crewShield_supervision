The initial problem was identified in an Intervention Group where, in an unguided setting, a higher proportion of executive, solution-seeking queries correlated strongly and negatively with exam performance. A contemporaneous Comparison Group demonstrated that without guidance, these unproductive help-seeking patterns do not self-correct, with engage..."
