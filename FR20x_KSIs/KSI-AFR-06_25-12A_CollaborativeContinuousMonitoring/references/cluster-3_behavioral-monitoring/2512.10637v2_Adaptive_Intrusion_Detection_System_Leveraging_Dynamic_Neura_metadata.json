  "summary": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are critical components in safeguarding 5G/6G networks from both internal and external cyber threats. While traditional IDS approaches rely heavily on signature-based methods, they struggle to detect novel and evolving attacks. This paper presents an advanced IDS framework that leverages adversarial training and dynamic neural networks in 5G/6G networks to enhance network security by providing robust, real-time threat detection and response capabilities.
