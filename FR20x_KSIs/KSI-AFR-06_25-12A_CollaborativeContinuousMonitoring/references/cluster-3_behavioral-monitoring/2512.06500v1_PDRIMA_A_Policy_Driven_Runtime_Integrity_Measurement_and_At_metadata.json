  "summary": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as ARM TrustZone are widely used in IoT and embedded devices to protect sensitive code and data. However, most existing defenses focus on secure boot or REE-side monitoring and provide little visibility into the runtime integrity of the TEE. This leaves TrustZone-based devices exposed to persistent TEE compromises. We propose Policy-Driven Runtime Integrity Measurement and Attestation (PDRIMA), a runtime integrity protection approach for TrustZone-based..."
