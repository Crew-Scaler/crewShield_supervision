  "summary": "Non-terrestrial base stations (NTBSs), including high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and hot-air balloons (HABs), are integral to next-generation wireless networks, offering coverage in remote areas and enhancing capacity in dense regions. In this paper, we propose a distributed beamforming framework for a massive MIMO network with a constellation of aerial platform stations (APSs). Our approach leverages an entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, where each APS op..."
