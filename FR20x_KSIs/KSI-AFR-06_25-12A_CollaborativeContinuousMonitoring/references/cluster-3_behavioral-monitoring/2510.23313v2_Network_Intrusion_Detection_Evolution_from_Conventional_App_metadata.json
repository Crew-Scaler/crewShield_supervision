  "summary": "This survey systematizes the evolution of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), from conventional methods such as signature-based and neural network (NN)-based approaches to recent integrations with large language models (LLMs). It clearly and concisely summarizes the current status, strengths, and limitations of conventional techniques, and explores the practical benefits of integrating LLMs into NIDS. Recent research on the application of LLMs to NIDS in diverse environments is reviewed,..."
