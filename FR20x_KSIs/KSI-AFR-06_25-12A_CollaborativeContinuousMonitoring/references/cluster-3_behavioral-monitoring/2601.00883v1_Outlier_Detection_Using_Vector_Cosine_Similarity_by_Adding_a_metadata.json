  "summary": "We propose a new outlier detection method for multi-dimensional data. The method detects outliers based on vector cosine similarity, using a new dataset constructed by adding a dimension with zero values to the original data. When a point in the new dataset is selected as the measured point, an observation point is created as the origin, differing only in the new dimension by having a non-zero value compared to the measured point. Vectors are then formed from the observation point to the measure..."
