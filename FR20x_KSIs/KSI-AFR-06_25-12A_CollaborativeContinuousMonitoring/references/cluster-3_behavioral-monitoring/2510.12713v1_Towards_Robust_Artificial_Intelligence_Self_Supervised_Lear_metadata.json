  "summary": "Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data, thereby increasing the AI systems' robus..."
