  "summary": "Evolving attacks are a critical challenge for the long-term success of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The rise of these changing patterns has exposed the limitations of traditional network security methods. While signature-based methods are used to detect different types of attacks, they often fail to detect unknown attacks. Moreover, the system requires frequent updates with new signatures as the attackers are constantly changing their tactics. In this paper, we design an environme..."
