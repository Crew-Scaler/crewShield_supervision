  "summary": "Accurate segmentation of the tooth point cloud is of great significance for diagnosis clinical assisting and treatment planning. Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, s"
