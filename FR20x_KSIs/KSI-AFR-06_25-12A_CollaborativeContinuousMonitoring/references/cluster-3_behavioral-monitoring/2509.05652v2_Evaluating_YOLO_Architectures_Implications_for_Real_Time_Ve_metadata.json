  "summary": "Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1..."
