  "summary": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are trained to predict forecast error for the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model using the New York State Mesonet and Oklahoma State Mesonet near-surface weather observations as ground truth. Physical and dynamical mechanisms tied to LSTM performance are evaluated by comparing the New York domain to the Oklahoma domain. The contrasting geography and atmospheric dynamics of the two domains provide a compelling scientific foil. Evaluating them side by s..."
