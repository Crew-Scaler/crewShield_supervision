  "summary": "Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) hosting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have attracted considerable attention for quantum sensing applications, particularly owing to notable advancements achieved in the field of weak magnetic signal detection in recent years. Here, we report a practical quantum-sensing platform for the controlled production and real-time monitoring of ultra-short-lived reactive free"
