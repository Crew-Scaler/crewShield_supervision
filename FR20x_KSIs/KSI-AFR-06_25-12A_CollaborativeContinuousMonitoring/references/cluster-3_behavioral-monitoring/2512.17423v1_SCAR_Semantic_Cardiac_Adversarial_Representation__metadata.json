  "summary": "Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis have achieved expert-level performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, applying Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to ECG signals presents a unique challenge: standard imperceptible noise constraints (e.g., 10 uV) fail to generate effective universal attacks due to the high inter-subject variability of cardiac "
