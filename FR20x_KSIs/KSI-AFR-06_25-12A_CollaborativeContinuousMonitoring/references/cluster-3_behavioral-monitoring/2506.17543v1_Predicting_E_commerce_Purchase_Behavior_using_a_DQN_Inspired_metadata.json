  "summary": "This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management, personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context, combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long ..."
