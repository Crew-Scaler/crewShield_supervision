  "summary": "The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and implementation of standardized open interfaces. It also facilitates closed loop control and (non/near) real-time optimization of radio access network (RAN) through the integration of non-real-time applications (rApps) and near-real-time applications (xApps). However, one of the security ..."
