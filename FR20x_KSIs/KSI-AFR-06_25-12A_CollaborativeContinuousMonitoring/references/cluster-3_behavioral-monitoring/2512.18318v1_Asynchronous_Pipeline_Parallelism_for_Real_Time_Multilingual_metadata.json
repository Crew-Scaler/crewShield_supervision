  "summary": "This paper introduces a parallel and asynchronous Transformer framework designed for efficient and accurate multilingual lip synchronization in real-time video conferencing systems. The proposed architecture integrates translation, speech processing, and lip-synchronization modules within a pipeline-parallel design that enables concurrent module execution through message-queue-based decoupling, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3.1 times compared to sequential approaches. To enhance computati..."
