  "summary": "Modern experimental platforms such as particle accelerators, fusion devices, telescopes, and industrial process control systems expose tens to hundreds of thousands of control and diagnostic channels accumulated over decades of evolution. Operators and AI systems rely on informal expert knowledge, inconsistent naming conventions, and fragmented documentation to locate signals for monitoring, troubleshooting, and automated control, creating a persistent bottleneck for reliability, scalability, an..."
