  "summary": "The trust-based nature of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) makes it vulnerable to disruptions like prefix hijacking and misconfigurations, threatening routing stability. Traditional detection relies on manual inspection with limited scalability. Machine/Deep Learning (M/DL) approaches automate detection but suffer from suboptimal precision, limited generalizability, and high retraining costs. This is"
