  "summary": "Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in coherent Ising machines (CIMs) are studied via a spectral mapping between the one-dimensional XY spin model and a network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs). This exact correspondence reveals that the DOPO network faithfully reproduces the quantum critical behavior of the XY model across its anisotropic, isotropic, and transverse-field Ising regimes. The ground-state energy density and its derivatives are analyzed to reveal second-order QPTs ..."
