  "summary": "Stereo cameras closely mimic human binocular vision, providing rich spatial cues critical for precise robotic manipulation. Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extractio"
