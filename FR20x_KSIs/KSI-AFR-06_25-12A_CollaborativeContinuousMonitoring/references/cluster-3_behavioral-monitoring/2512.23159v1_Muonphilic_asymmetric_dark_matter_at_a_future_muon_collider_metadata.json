  "summary": "We explore phenomenological constraints on, and future muon collider sensitivities to, the parameter spaces of various muonphilic portals to fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM). Both WEFT-level dimension-6 effective operators and two UV models based on gauged $L_\u03bc- L_\u03c4$ are considered. One of the latter features a vector coupling to the dark matter and the other an axial vector coupling. The ADM criterion that at least $99\\%$ of the dark matter relic density is asymmetric is also imposed. We ..."
