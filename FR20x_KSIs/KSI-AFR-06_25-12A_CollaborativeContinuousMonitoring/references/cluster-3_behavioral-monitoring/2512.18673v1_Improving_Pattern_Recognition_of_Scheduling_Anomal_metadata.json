  "summary": "This paper proposes a structure-aware driven scheduling graph modeling method to improve the accuracy and representation capability of anomaly identification in scheduling behaviors of complex systems. The method first designs a structure-guided scheduling graph construction mechanism that integrates task execution stages, resource node states, and scheduling path information to build dynamically "
