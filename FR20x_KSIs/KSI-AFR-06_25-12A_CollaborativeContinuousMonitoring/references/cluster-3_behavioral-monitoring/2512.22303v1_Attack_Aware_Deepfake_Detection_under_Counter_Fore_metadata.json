  "summary": "This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic res"
