  "summary": "Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-rank common latent structure while also containing individual-specific components. We analyze the si..."
