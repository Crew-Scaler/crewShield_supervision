  "summary": "Underwater imaging is essential for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, water causes severe image degradation through wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and haze effects. Traditional reconstruction methods and convolutional neural network-based approaches often fail to adequately address the"
