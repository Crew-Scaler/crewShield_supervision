  "summary": "Prior research yielded many techniques to mitigate software compromise for low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Some of them detect software modifications via remote attestation and similar services, while others preventatively ensure software (static) integrity. However, achieving run-time (dynamic) security, e.g., control-flow integrity (CFI), remains a challenge.\n  Control-flow attestation"
