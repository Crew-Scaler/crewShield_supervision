  "summary": "Evolutionary therapy (ET) aims to steer tumor evolution by adjusting treatment timing and dosing to control rather than eradicate tumor burden. Clinical use requires reliable monitoring of tumor dynamics to inform mathematical models that guide therapy. In cancers such as metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, ET models are informed by serial "
