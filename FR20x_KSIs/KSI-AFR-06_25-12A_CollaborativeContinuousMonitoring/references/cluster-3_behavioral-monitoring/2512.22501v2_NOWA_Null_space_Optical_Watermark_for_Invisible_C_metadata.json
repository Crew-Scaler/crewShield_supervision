  "summary": "Ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital images is increasingly challenging as modern editing tools enable highly realistic forgeries. Existing image protection systems mainly rely on digital watermarking, which is susceptible to sophisticated digital attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid optical-digital framework that incorporates physical authentication cues during i"
