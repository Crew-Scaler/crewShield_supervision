  "summary": "Existing open-source film restoration methods show limited performance compared to commercial methods due to training with low-quality synthetic data and employing noisy optical flows. In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful conte"
