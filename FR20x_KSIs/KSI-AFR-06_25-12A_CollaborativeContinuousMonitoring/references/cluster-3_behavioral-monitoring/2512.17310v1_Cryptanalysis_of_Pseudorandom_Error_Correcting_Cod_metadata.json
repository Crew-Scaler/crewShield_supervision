  "summary": "Pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRC) is a novel cryptographic primitive proposed at CRYPTO 2024. Due to the dual capability of pseudorandomness and error correction, PRC has been recognized as a promising foundational component for watermarking AI-generated content. However, the security of PRC has not been thoroughly analyzed, especially with concrete parameters or even in the face of crypto"
