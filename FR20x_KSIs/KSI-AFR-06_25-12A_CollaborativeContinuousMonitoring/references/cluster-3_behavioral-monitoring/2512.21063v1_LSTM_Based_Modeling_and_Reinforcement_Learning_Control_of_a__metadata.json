  "summary": "Autonomous magnetic catheter systems are emerging as a promising approach for the future of minimally invasive interventions. This study presents a novel approach that begins by modeling the nonlinear and hysteretic dynamics of a magnetically actuated catheter system, consists of a magnetic catheter manipulated by servo-controlled magnetic fields generated by two external permanent magnets, and its complex behavior is captured using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. This model vali..."
