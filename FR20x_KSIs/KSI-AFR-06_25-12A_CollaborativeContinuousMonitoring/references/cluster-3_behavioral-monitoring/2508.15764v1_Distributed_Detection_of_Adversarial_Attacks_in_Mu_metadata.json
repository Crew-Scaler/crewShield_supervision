  "summary": "We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the "
