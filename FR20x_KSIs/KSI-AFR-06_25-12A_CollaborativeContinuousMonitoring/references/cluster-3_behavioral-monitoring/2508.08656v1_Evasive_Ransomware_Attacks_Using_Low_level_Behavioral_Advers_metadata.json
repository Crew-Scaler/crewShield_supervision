  "summary": "Protecting state-of-the-art AI-based cybersecurity defense systems from cyber attacks is crucial. Attackers create adversarial examples by adding small changes (i.e., perturbations) to the attack features to evade or fool the deep learning model. This paper introduces the concept of low-level behavioral adversarial examples and its threat model of evasive ransomware. We formulate the method and the threat model to generate the optimal source code of evasive malware. We then examine the method us..."
