  "summary": "The National Solar Observatory (NSO)'s Farside Pipeline is a critical tool of the space weather industry. It enables the detection and tracking of solar active regions that have rotated to the farside (invisible surface) of the Sun without relying on direct observational platforms such as satellites. By applying the technique of helioseismic holography to continuous Doppler images of the front sid"
