  "summary": "This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for in-situ process monitoring that captures nonlinear relationships between in-control high-dimensional process signature signals and offline product quality data. Specifically, we introduce a Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA)-based framework that enables the joint feature extraction and correlation analysis of multi-modal data sources, such as optical emission spectra and CT scan images, which are collected in advanced manufacturing p..."
