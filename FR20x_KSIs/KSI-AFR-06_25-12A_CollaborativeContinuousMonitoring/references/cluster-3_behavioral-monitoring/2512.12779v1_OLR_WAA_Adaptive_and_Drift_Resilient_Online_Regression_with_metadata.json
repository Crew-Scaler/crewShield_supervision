  "summary": "Real-world datasets frequently exhibit evolving data distributions, reflecting temporal variations and underlying shifts. Overlooking this phenomenon, known as concept drift, can substantially degrade the predictive performance of the model. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue, as these parameters are typically fixed and lack the flexibility to dynamically adjust to evolving data. This paper introduces \"OLR-WAA: An Adaptive and Drift-Resilient Onl..."
