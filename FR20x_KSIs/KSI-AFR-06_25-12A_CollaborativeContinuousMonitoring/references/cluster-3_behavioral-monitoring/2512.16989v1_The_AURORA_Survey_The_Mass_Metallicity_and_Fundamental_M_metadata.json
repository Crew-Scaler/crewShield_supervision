  "summary": "We present new constraints on the Mass -- Metallicity (MZR) and Fundamental Metallicity Relations (FMR) using a sample of 34 galaxies at $1.38\\leq~z\\leq~3.5$ (median $z=2.28$). These galaxies have direct $T_e$ measurements from [O\\sc{iii}]4363\u00c5~and/or [O\\sc{ii}]7320,7331\u00c5~auroral emission lines detected with \\textit{JWST}/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey. The detection of both oxygen auroral lines allows for dual-zone direct $T_e$ measurements and expands the dynamic range in $12+\\log\\mathrm..."
