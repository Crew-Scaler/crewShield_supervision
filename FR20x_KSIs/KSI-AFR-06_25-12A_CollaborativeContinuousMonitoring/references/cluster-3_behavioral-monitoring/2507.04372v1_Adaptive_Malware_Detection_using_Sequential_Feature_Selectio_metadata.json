  "summary": "Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per sample before terminating with class..."
