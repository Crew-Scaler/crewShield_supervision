  "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, statistical heterogeneity among clients, often manifested as non-IID label distributions, poses significant challenges to convergence and generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been introduced to FL to seek flatter, more robust minima, existin"
