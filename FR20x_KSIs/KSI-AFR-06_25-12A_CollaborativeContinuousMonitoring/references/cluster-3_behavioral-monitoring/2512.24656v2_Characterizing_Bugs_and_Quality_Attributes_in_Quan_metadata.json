  "summary": "Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is essential for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of hybrid quantum-classical systems, yet empirical evidence on how bugs emerge and affect quality in real-world quantum projects remains limited. This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software bugs across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning "
