  "summary": "With the widespread adoption of Artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based tools and components are becoming omnipresent in today's solutions. However, these components and tools are posing a significant threat when it comes to adversarial attacks. Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that leverages the collective participation of workers and their smart devices to collect data. One of the key challenges faced at the selection stage is ensuring task completion due to workers' varying beha..."
