  "summary": "Electrical tomography techniques have been widely employed for multiphase-flow monitoring owing to their non invasive nature, intrinsic safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, conventional reconstructions struggle to capture fine details, which hampers broader adoption. Motivated by recent advances in deep learning, this study introduces a Pix2Pix generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). Comprehensive simulated and experimental ..."
