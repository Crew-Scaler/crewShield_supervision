  "summary": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) are showing promising impact in software development and programming assistance. However, these models struggle when operating on low-level backend code. This challenge is exacerbated in the domain of GPU kernels, where performance-critical details are coupled to rapidly evolving hardware characteristics and available code examples are sparse.\n  In this work, we introduce PEAK, a Performance Engineering AI-Assistant for GPU Kernels powered by natural ..."
