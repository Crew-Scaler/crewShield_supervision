  "summary": "Virtual representations of physical critical infrastructures, such as water or energy plants, are used for simulations and digital twins to ensure resilience and continuity of their services. These models usually require 3D point clouds from laser scanners that are expensive to acquire and require specialist knowledge to use. In this article, we present a graph generation pipeline based on photogrammetry. The pipeline detects relevant objects and predicts their relation using RGB images and dept..."
