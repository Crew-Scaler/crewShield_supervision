  "summary": "Wind energy significantly contributes to the global shift towards renewable energy, yet operational challenges, such as Leading-Edge Erosion on wind turbine blades, notably reduce energy output. This study introduces an advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using Supervisory Control and Data A"
