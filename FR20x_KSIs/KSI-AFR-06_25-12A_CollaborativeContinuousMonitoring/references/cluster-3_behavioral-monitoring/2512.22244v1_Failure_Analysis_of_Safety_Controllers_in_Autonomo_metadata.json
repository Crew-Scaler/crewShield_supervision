  "summary": "Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR based perception to support safety critical control functions such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a sy"
