  "summary": "While the digitization of industrial factories provides tremendous improvements for the production of goods, it also renders such systems vulnerable to serious cyber-attacks. To research, test, and validate security measures protecting industrial networks against such cyber-attacks, the security community relies on testbeds to simulate industrial systems, as utilizing live systems endangers costly components or even human life. However, existing testbeds focus on individual parts of typically co..."
