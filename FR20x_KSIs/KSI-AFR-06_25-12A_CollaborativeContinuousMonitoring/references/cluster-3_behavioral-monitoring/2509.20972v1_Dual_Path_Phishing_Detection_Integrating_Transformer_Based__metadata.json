  "summary": "Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat, undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) with classical mac..."
