  "summary": "Silicon photonic components based on freely propagating beams in 220 nm thick Si slab waveguides are described and characterized. Examples include optical relays, waveguide crossings, couplers, and resonators with wavelength independent Q factors. The unconfined beams are manipulated using reflecting mirrors etched into the Si layer, which operate in the total internal reflection (TIR) regime. This approach eliminates the back-scattering and waveguide loss arising from sidewall roughness in sing..."
