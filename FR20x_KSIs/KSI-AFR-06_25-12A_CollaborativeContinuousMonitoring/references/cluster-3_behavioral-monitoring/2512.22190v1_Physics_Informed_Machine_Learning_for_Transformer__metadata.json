  "summary": "Power transformers are critical assets in power networks, whose reliability directly impacts grid resilience and stability. Traditional condition monitoring approaches, often rule-based or purely physics-based, struggle with uncertainty, limited data availability, and the complexity of modern operating conditions. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) provide powerful tools to complement and ex"
