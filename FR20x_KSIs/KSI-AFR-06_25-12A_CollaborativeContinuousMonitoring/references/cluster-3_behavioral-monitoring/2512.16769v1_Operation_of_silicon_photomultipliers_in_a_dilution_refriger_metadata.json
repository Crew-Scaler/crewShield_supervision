  "summary": "We report the characterisation of a FBK NUV-HD-cryo silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) sensor operated in an 9.4 $\\pm$ 0.2 mK environment inside a dilution refrigerator, towards the development of a cryogenic cosmic ray muon veto system to be operated internal to a dilution refrigerator required for low background experiments such as the QUEST-DMC dark matter search experiment. We characterise the single photon response and the gain (the charge produced per detected photon), the dark count noise rat..."
