  "summary": "This paper studies the synthesis and mitigation of stealthy attacks in nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPS). To quantify stealthiness, we employ the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure rooted in hypothesis testing and detection theory, which captures the trade-off between an attacker's desire to remain stealthy and her goal of degrading system performance. First, we synthesize the worst-case stealthy attack in nonlinear CPS using the path integral approach. Second, we consider how a co..."
