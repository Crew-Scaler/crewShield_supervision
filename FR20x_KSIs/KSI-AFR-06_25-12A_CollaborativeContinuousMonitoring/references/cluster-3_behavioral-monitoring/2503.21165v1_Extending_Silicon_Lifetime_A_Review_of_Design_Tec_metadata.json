  "summary": "Reliability has become an increasing concern in modern computing. Integrated circuits (ICs) are the backbone of modern computing devices across industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), consumer electronics, healthcare, automotive, industrial, and aerospace. Moore Law has driven the semiconductor IC industry toward smaller dimensions, improved performance, and greater energy efficiency. "
