  "summary": "As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold (\u03b5) in real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle..."
