  "summary": "The key to success in automating prior art search in patent research using artificial intelligence (AI) lies in developing large datasets for machine learning (ML) and ensuring their availability. This work is dedicated to providing a comprehensive solution to the problem of creating infrastructure for research in this field, including datasets and tools for calculating search quality criteria. The paper discusses the concept of semantic clusters of patent documents that determine the state of t..."
