  "summary": "As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled f..."
