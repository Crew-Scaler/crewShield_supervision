  "summary": "The automotive domain is shifting to software-centric development to meet regulation, market pressure, and feature velocity. This shift increases embedded systems' complexity and strains testing capacity. Despite relevant standards, a coherent system-testing methodology that spans heterogeneous, legacy-constrained toolchains remains elusive, and practice often depends on individual expertise rather than a systematic strategy. We derive challenges and requirements from a systematic literature rev..."
