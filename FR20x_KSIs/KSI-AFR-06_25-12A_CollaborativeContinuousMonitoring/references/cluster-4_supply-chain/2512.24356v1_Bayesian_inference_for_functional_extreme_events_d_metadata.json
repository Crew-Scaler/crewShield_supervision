  "summary": "In order to describe the extremal behaviour of some stochastic process $X$, approaches from univariate extreme value theory are typically generalized to the spatial domain. In particular, generalized peaks-over-threshold approaches allow for the consideration of single extreme events. These can be flexibly defined as exceedances of a risk functional $r$, such as a spatial average, applied to $X$. "
