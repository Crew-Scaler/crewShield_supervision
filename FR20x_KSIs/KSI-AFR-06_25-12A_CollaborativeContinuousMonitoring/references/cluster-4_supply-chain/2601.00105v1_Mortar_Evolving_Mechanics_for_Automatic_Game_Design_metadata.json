  "summary": "We present Mortar, a system for autonomously evolving game mechanics for automatic game design. Game mechanics define the rules and interactions that govern gameplay, and designing them manually is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are eva..."
