  "summary": "Selecting the number of communities is a fundamental challenge in network clustering. The silhouette score offers an intuitive, model-free criterion that balances within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation. Albeit its widespread use in clustering analysis, its performance in network-based community detection remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we comprehensively evalua"
