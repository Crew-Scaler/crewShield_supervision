  "summary": "Hypervisors are under threat by critical memory safety vulnerabilities, with pointer corruption being one of the most prevalent and severe forms. Existing exploitation frameworks depend on identifying highly-constrained structures in the host machine and accurately determining their runtime addresses, which is ineffective in hypervisor environments where such structures are rare and further obfusc"
