  "summary": "Embodied robotic AI systems designed to manage complex daily tasks rely on a task planner to understand and decompose high-level tasks. While most research focuses on enhancing the task-understanding abilities of LLMs/VLMs through fine-tuning or chain-of-thought prompting, this paper argues that defining the planned skill set is equally crucial. To handle the complexity of daily environments, the skill set should possess a high degree of generalization ability. Empirically, more abstract express..."
