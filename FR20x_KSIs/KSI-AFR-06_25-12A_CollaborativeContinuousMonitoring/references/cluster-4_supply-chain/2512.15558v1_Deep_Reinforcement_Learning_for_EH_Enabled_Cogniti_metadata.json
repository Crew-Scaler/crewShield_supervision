  "summary": "In the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating cognitive radio (CR) has become a practical solution to address the challenge of spectrum scarcity, leading to the development of cognitive IoT (CIoT). However, the vulnerability of radio communications makes radio jamming attacks a key concern in CIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (D"
