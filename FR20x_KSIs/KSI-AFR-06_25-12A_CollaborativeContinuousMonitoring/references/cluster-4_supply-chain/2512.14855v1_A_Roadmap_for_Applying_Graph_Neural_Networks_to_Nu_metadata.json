  "summary": "Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly applied in concrete research to optimize performance and mixture design. However, one major challenge in applying ML to cementitious materials is the limited size and diversity of available databases. A promising solution is the development of multi-modal databases that integrate both numerical and graphical data. Conventional ML frameworks in cement res"
