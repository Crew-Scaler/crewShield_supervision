  "summary": "Passive and bistatic radar systems are often limited by strong clutter and direct-path interference that mask weak moving targets. Conventional cancellation methods such as the extensive cancellation algorithm require careful tuning and can distort the delay-Doppler response. This paper introduces a convex optimization framework that adaptively synthesizes per-cell delay-Doppler filters to suppres"
