  "summary": "Deep learning-based object detection models play a critical role in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and security surveillance systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose an autoencoder-based denoising defense to recover object detection performance degraded by adversarial perturbations. We conduct adversarial attacks using Perlin noise on vehicle-related images from the COCO dataset, apply a single-layer convolutional autoencoder to re..."
