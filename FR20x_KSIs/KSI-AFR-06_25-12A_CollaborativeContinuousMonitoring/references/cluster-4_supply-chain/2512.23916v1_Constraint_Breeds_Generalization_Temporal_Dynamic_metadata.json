  "summary": "Conventional deep learning prioritizes unconstrained optimization, yet biological systems operate under strict metabolic constraints. We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify"
