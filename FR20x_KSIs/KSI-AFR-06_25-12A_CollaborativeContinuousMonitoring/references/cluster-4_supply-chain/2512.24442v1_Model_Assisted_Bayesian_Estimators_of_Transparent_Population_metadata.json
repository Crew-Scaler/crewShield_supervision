  "summary": "In randomized controlled trials, ordinal outcomes typically improve statistical efficiency over binary outcomes. The treatment effect on an ordinal outcome is usually described by the odds ratio from a proportional odds model, but this summary measure lacks transparency with respect to its emphasis on the components of the ordinal outcome when proportional odds is violated. We propose various summary measures for ordinal outcomes that are fully transparent in this regard, including 'weighted geo..."
