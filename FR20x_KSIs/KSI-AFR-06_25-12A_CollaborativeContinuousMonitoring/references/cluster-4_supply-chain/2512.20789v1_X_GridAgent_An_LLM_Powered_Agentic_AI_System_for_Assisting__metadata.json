  "summary": "The growing complexity of power system operations has created an urgent need for intelligent, automated tools to support reliable and efficient grid management. Conventional analysis tools often require significant domain expertise and manual effort, which limits their accessibility and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper presents X-GridAgent, a novel large language model (LLM)-powered agentic AI system designed to automate complex power system analysis through natural language..."
