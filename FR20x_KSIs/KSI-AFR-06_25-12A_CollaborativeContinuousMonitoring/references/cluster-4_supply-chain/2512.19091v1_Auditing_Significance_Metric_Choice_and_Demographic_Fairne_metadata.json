  "summary": "Open challenges have become the de facto standard for comparative ranking of medical AI methods. Despite their importance, medical AI leaderboards exhibit three persistent limitations: (1) score gaps are rarely tested for statistical significance, so rank stability is unknown; (2) single averaged metrics are applied to every organ, hiding clinically important boundary errors; (3) performance across intersecting demographics is seldom reported, masking fairness and equity gaps. We introduce RankI..."
