  "summary": "We present a novel multi-stage workflow for computational materials discovery that achieves a 99% success rate in identifying compounds within 100 meV/atom of thermodynamic stability, with a threefold improvement over previous approaches. By combining the Matra-Genoa generative model, Orb-v2 universal machine learning interatomic potential, and ALIGNN graph neural network for energy prediction, we"
