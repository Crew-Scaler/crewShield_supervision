  "summary": "Digital crown design remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in restorative dentistry. We present CrownGen, a generative framework that automates patient-customized crown design using a denoising diffusion model on a novel tooth-level point cloud representation. The system employs two core components: a boundary prediction module to establish spatial priors and a diffusion-based generative module to synthesize high-fidelity morphology for multiple teeth in a single inference pass. We validated Crow..."
