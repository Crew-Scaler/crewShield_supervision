  "summary": "Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited "
