  "summary": "The ability to extract value from historical data is essential for enterprise decision-making. However, much of this information remains inaccessible within large legacy file systems that lack structured organization and semantic indexing, making retrieval and analysis inefficient and error-prone. We introduce SPAR (Session-based Pipeline for Adaptive Retrieval), a conceptual framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture specifica..."
