  "summary": "While Deep Learning has improved Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) decoding accuracy, clinical adoption is hindered by the \"Black Box\" nature of these algorithms, leading to user frustration and poor neuroplasticity outcomes. We propose OmniNeuro, a novel HCI framework that transforms the BCI from a silent decoder into a transparent feedback partner. OmniNeuro integrates three interpretability engines: (1) Physics (Energy), (2) Chaos (Fractal Complexity), and (3) Quantum-Inspired uncertainty modeli..."
