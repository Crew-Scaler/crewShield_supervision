  "summary": "The rapid adoption of open source machine learning (ML) datasets and models exposes today's AI applications to critical risks like data poisoning and supply chain attacks across the ML lifecycle. With growing regulatory pressure to address these issues through greater transparency, ML model vendors face challenges balancing these requirements against confidentiality for data and intellectual property needs. We propose Atlas, a framework that enables fully attestable ML pipelines. Atlas leverages..."
