  "summary": "Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clus"
