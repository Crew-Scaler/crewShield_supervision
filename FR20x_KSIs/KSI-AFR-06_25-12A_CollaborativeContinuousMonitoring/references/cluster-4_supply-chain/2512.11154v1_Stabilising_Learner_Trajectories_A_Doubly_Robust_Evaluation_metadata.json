  "summary": "While predictive models are increasingly common in higher education, causal evidence regarding the interventions they trigger remains rare. This study evaluates an AI-guided student support system at a large university using doubly robust propensity score matching. We advance the methodology for learning analytics evaluation by leveraging time-aligned, dynamic AI probability of success scores to match 1,859 treated students to controls, thereby mitigating the selection and immortal time biases o..."
