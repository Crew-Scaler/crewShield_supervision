  "summary": "Shrimp is one of the most widely consumed aquatic species globally, valued for both its nutritional content and economic importance. Shrimp farming represents a significant source of income in many regions; however, like other forms of aquaculture, it is severely impacted by disease outbreaks. These diseases pose a major challenge to sustainable shrimp production. To address this issue, automated disease classification methods can offer timely and accurate detection. This research proposes a dee..."
