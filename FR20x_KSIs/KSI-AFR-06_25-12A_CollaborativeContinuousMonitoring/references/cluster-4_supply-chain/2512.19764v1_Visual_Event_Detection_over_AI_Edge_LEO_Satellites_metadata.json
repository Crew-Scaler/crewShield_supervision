  "summary": "Non terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, play a vital role in supporting future mission critical applications such as disaster relief. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, co"
