  "summary": "In recent years, the growing frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased the need for effective tools to manage catastrophe risk. Catastrophe (CAT) bonds allow the transfer of part of this risk to investors, offering an alternative to traditional reinsurance. This paper examines the role of climate variability in CAT bond pricing and evaluates the predictive performance of various m"
