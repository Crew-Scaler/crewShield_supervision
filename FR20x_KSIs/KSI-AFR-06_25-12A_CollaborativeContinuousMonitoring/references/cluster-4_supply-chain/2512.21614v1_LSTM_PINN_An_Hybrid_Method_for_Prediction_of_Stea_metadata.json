  "summary": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have demonstrated considerable success in solving complex fluid dynamics problems. However, their performance often deteriorates in regimes characterized by steep gradients, intricate boundary conditions, and stringent physical constraints, leading to convergence failures and numerical instabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framew"
