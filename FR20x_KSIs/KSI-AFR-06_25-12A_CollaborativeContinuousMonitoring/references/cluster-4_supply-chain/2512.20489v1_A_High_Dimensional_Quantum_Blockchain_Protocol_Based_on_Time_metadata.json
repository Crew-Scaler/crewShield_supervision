  "summary": "Rapid advancements in quantum computing and machine learning threaten the long-term security of classical blockchain systems, whose protection mechanisms largely rely on computational difficulties. In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block inf..."
