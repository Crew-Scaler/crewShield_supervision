  "summary": "Risk management often plays an important role in decision making under uncertainty. In quantitative risk management, assessing and optimizing risk metrics requires efficient computing techniques and reliable theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we introduce several topics on quantitative risk management and review some of the recent studies and advancements on the topics. We consider several ris"
