  "summary": "Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \\textit{training} techniques, effective automa"
