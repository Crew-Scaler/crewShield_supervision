  "summary": "Simulating physics processes and detector responses is essential in high energy physics and represents significant computing costs. Generative machine learning has been demonstrated to be potentially powerful in accelerating simulations, outperforming traditional fast simulation methods. The efforts have focused primarily on calorimeters. This work presents the very first studies on using neural n"
