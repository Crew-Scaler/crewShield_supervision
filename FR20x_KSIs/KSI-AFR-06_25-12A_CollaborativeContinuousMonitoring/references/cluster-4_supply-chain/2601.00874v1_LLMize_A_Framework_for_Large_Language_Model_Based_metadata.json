  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning capabilities beyond traditional language tasks, motivating their use for numerical optimization. This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are "
