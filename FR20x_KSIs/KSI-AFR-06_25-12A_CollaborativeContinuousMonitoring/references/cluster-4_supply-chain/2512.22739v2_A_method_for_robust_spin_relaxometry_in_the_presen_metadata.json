  "summary": "Spin relaxometry based on quantum spin systems has developed as a valuable tool in medical and condensed matter systems, offering the advantage of operating without the need for external DC or RF fields. Spin relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been applied to paramagnetic sensing using both single crystal diamond and nanodiamond materials. However, these methods often suffer from a"
