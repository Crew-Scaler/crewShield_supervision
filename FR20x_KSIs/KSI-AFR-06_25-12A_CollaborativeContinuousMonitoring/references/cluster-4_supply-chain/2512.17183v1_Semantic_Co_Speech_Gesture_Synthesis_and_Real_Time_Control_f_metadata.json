  "summary": "We present an innovative end-to-end framework for synthesizing semantically meaningful co-speech gestures and deploying them in real-time on a humanoid robot. This system addresses the challenge of creating natural, expressive non-verbal communication for robots by integrating advanced gesture generation techniques with robust physical control. Our core innovation lies in the meticulous integration of a semantics-aware gesture synthesis module, which derives expressive reference motions from spe..."
