  "summary": "With deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly embedded in modern society, ensuring their safety has become a critical and urgent issue. In response, substantial efforts have been dedicated to the red-blue adversarial framework, where the red team focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in DNNs and the blue team on mitigating them. However, existing approaches from both teams remain computationally "
