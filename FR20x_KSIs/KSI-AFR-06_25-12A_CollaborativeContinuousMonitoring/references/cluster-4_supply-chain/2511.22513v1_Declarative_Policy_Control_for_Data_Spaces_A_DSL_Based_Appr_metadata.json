  "summary": "The growing adoption of federated data spaces, such as in the GAIA-X and the International Data Spaces (IDS) initiative, promises secure and sovereign data sharing across organizational boundaries in Industry 4.0. In manufacturing ecosystems, this enables use cases, such as cross-factory process optimization, predictive maintenance, and supplier integration. Frameworks and standards, such as the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC), ID-Link and Open Platform Commun..."
