  "summary": "RNA's diverse biological functions stem from its structural versatility, yet accurately predicting and designing RNA sequences given a 3D conformation (inverse folding) remains a challenge. Here, I introduce a deep learning framework that integrates Geometric Vector Perceptron (GVP) layers with a Transformer architecture to enable end-to-end RNA design. I construct a dataset consisting of experime"
