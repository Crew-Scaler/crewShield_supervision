  "summary": "We present an interacting branching model of neural network dynamics, incorporating key biological features such as inhibition with several types of inhibitory interactions. We establish a hierarchy of analytical mean-field approximations to the model, which characterizes nonequilibrium phase transitions between disorder and ordered phases, and perform a stability analysis. Generically, inhibitory neurons increase the stability of the model dynamics. The model is consistent with the quasi-critic..."
