  "summary": "In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), compressed Higgsinos spectrum ($\u0394m^0 \\lesssim 1$ GeV) occurs when $|\u03bc| \\ll |M_1|, |M_2|$ and ${\\rm sign}(M_1\\cdot M_2)<0$, which leads to a long-lived next-to-lightest neutralino. Such a long-lived neutralino could be copiously produced at the LHC, however escape the detection at the LHC main detectors. We examine the discovery potential at the FASER experiment and find that the FASER 2 could cover the neutral Higgsino mass up to about 130 GeV..."
