  "summary": "In this paper, we revisit the well-known perturbed Duffing system and investigate its chaotic dynamics by means of numerical Runge--Kutta method based on topological horseshoe theory. Precisely, we investigate chaos through the topological horseshoes associated with the first, second, and third return maps, obtained by varying the amplitude of an external force term while keeping all other paramet"
