  "summary": "Benign laryngeal voice disorders affect nearly one in five individuals and often manifest as dysphonia, while also serving as non-invasive indicators of broader physiological dysfunction. We introduce a clinically inspired hierarchical machine learning framework for automated classification of eight benign voice disorders alongside healthy controls, using acoustic features extracted from short, su"
