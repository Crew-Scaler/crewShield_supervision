  "summary": "Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \\emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \\emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \\emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \\emph{triangulation}, an acceptance..."
