  "summary": "Because of the enormous number of possible compositions, comparable to the number of stars in the universe, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) constitute a virtually inexhaustible materials space with highly versatile properties. Among these systems, HEAs are often proposed as potential substitutes for critical elements such as rare earths or platinum group metals. However, random or incremental exploration strategies are neither practical nor efficient at this scale. Targeted materials selection guided..."
