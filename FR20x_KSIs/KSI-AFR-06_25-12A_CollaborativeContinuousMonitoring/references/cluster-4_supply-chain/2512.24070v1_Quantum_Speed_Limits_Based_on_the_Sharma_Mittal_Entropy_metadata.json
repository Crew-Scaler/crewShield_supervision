  "summary": "Quantum speed limits (QSLs) establish intrinsic bounds on the minimum time required for the evolution of quantum systems. We present a class of QSLs formulated in terms of the two-parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME), applicable to finite-dimensional systems evolving under general nonunitary dynamics. In the single-qubit case, the QSLs for both quantum channels and non-Hermitian dynamics are analyzed in detail. For many-body systems, we explore the role of SME-based bounds in characterizing the..."
