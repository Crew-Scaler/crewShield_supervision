  "summary": "Semantic communication and edge-cloud collaborative intelligence are increasingly recognized as foundational enablers for next-generation intelligent services operating under stringent bandwidth, latency, and resource constraints. By shifting the communication objective from bit-perfect delivery toward the transmission of task-relevant semantic representations, semantic communication enables adaptive tradeoffs among communication overhead, inference accuracy, computational load, and end-to-end l..."
