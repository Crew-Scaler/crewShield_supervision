  "summary": "Modern networked systems rely on complex software stacks, which often conceal vulnerabilities arising from intricate interdependencies. A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is effective for identifying dependencies and mitigating security risks. However, existing SBOM solutions lack precision, particularly in binary analysis and non-package-managed languages like C/C++.\n  This paper introduces UniBOM, an advanced tool for SBOM generation, analysis, and visualisation, designed to enhance the secur..."
