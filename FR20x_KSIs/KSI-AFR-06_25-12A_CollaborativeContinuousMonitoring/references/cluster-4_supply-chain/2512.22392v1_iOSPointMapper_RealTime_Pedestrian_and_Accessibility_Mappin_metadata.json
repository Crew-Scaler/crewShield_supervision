  "summary": "Accurate, up-to-date sidewalk data is essential for building accessible and inclusive pedestrian infrastructure, yet current approaches to data collection are often costly, fragmented, and difficult to scale. We introduce iOSPointMapper, a mobile application that enables real-time, privacy-conscious sidewalk mapping on the ground, using recent-generation iPhones and iPads. The system leverages on-device semantic segmentation, LiDAR-based depth estimation, and fused GPS/IMU data to detect and loc..."
