  "summary": "Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a sign..."
