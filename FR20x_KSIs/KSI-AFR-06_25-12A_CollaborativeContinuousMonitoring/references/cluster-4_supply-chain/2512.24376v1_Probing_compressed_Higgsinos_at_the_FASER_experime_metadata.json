  "summary": "In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), compressed Higgsinos spectrum ($\u0394m^0 \\lesssim 1$ GeV) occurs when $|\u03bc| \\ll |M_1|, |M_2|$ and ${\\rm sign}(M_1\\cdot M_2)<0$, which leads to a long-lived next-to-lightest neutralino. Such a long-lived neutralino could be copiously produced at the LHC, however escape the detection at the LHC main detectors. We examine the discovery potential at the "
