  "summary": "Joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has become increasingly important in medical research, particularly for understanding disease progression in chronic conditions where both repeated biomarker measurements and time-to-event outcomes are available. Traditional two-stage methods, which analyze longitudinal and survival components separately, often result in biased estimates and subopti"
