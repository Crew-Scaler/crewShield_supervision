  "summary": "The framework of geometric extremes is based on the convergence of scaled sample clouds onto a limit set, characterized by a gauge function, with the shape of the limit set determining extremal dependence structures. While it is known that a blunt limit set implies asymptotic independence, the absence of bluntness can be linked to both asymptotic dependence and independence. Focusing on the bivari"
