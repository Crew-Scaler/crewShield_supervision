  "summary": "Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and n..."
