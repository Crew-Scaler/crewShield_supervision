  "summary": "Accurate prediction of self-pressurization in cryogenic tanks requires resolving the coupled effects of heat ingress, natural convection, and phase change. This work introduces a segregated numerical framework in which the liquid and vapor phases are treated with incompressible and compressible solvers, respectively, and the liquid-vapor interface is modeled as a sharp boundary subject to energy-j"
