  "summary": "Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning require..."
