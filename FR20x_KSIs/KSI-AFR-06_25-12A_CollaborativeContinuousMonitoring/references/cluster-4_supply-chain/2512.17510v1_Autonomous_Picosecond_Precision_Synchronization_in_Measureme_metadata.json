  "summary": "Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) eliminates detector side-channel attacks by relocating all measurements to an untrusted intermediate node. However, its practical implementation critically relies on picosecond-level temporal synchronization between spatially separated users. In this work, we present a physically motivated autonomous synchronization algorithm for fiber-based MDI-QKD networks that does not require auxiliary optical channels or shared clock referenc..."
