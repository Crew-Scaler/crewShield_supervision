  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed locally for privacy and accessibility, yet users lack tools to measure their resource usage, environmental impact, and efficiency metrics. This paper presents EnviroLLM, an open-source toolkit for tracking, benchmarking, and optimizing performance and energy consumption when running LLMs on personal devices. The system provides real-time proce"
