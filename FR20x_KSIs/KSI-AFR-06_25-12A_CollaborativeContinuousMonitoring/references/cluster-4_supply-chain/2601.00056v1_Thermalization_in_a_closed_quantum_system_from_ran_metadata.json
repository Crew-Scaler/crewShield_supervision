  "summary": "The emergence of statistical mechanics from quantum dynamics is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. Deriving observables aligned with the prediction of the canonical ensemble for a quantum system relies on the presence of a bath provided either as an external environment or as a larger part of a closed system. We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quant"
