  "summary": "Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical--UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have suffic..."
