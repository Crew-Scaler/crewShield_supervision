  "summary": "We study the impact of background-induced forces on dark matter (DM) annihilation and their implications for indirect detection. In the presence of a finite number density of background particles, loop-level interactions can generate an effective force that is significantly enhanced relative to the vacuum case. We construct a two-component DM model in which the dominant component is a fermionic particle $\u03c7$ and the subdominant component is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle $\u03c6$. The annihilatio..."
