  "summary": "Synchronization systems with effective inertia, such as power grid networks and coupled electromechanical oscillators, are commonly modeled by the second-order Kuramoto model. In the forward process, numerical simulations exhibit a staircase-like growth of global synchrony, reflecting temporal oscillations induced by secondary synchronized clusters of whirling oscillators. While this behavior has "
