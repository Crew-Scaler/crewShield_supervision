  "summary": "Double perovskites containing 4d--4f interactions provide a platform to study complex magnetic phenomena in correlated systems. Here, we investigate the magnetic ground state and quasiparticle excitations of the fascinating double perovskite system, Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$, through Time of flight (TOF) neutron diffraction (TOF), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical modelling. The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the..."
