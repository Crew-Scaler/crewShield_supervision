  "summary": "Risk-based AI regulation has become the dominant paradigm in AI governance, promising proportional controls aligned with anticipated harms. This paper argues that such frameworks often fail for structural reasons: they implicitly assume linear causality, stable system boundaries, and largely predictable responses to regulation. In practice, AI operates within complex adaptive socio-technical systems in which harm is frequently emergent, delayed, redistributed, and amplified through feedback loop..."
