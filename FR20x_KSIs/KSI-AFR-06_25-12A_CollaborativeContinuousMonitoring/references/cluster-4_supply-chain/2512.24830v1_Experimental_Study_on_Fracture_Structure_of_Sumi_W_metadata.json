  "summary": "Local variations in surface tension can induce complex fracture dynamics in thin interfacial films. Here, we investigate the fracture patterns that emerge when a localized surface-tension perturbation is applied to a sumi film supported on a water-glycerol subphase. Sumi is a traditional Japanese carbon black ink, and this process, referred to as sumi-wari, produces aesthetically pleasing, star-sh"
