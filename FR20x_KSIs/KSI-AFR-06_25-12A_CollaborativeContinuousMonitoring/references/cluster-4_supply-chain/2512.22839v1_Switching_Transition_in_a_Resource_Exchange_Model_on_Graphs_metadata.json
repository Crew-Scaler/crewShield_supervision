  "summary": "In this work, we investigate a simple nonequilibrium system with many interconnected, open subsystems, each exchanging a globally conserved resource with an external reserve. The system is represented by a random graph, where nodes represent the subsystems connected through edges. At each time step, a randomly selected node gains a token (i.e, a resource) from the reserve with probability (1-p) or loses a token to the reserve with probability p. When a node loses a token, its neighbors also lose..."
