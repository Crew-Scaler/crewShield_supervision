  "summary": "We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to mod"
