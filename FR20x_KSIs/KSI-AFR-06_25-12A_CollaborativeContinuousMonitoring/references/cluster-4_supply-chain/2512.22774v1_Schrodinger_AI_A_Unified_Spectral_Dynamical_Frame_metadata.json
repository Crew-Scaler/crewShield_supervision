  "summary": "We introduce \\textbf{Schr\u00f6dinger AI}, a unified machine learning framework inspired by quantum mechanics. The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over"
