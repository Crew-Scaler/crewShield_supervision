  "summary": "Since the inception of BERT, encoder-only Transformers have evolved significantly in computational efficiency, training stability, and long-context modeling. ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch, incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based ..."
