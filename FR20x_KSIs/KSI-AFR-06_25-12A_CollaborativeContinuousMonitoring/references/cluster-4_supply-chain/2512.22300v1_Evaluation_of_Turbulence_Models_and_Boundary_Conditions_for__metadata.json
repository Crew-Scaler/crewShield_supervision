  "summary": "In this paper, we study the ventilation airflow in a model classroom, where exhaust fans throw out the used air, to replace it with outdoor air through open door. Hybrid ventilation, or mechanically assisted natural ventilation, of this kind is used as a retrofit design to reduce infection risk from airborne transmission. The air stream entering the door forms a jet-like flow, driven by the suction effect of exhaust fans. We compute the jet velocity using Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) m..."
