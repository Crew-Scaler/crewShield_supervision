  "summary": "Bayesian profile regression mixture models (BPRM) allow to assess a health risk in a multi-exposed population. These mixture models cluster individuals according to their exposure profile and their health risk. However, their results, based on Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms, turned out to be unstable in different application cases. We suppose two reasons for this instability. The MCMC "
