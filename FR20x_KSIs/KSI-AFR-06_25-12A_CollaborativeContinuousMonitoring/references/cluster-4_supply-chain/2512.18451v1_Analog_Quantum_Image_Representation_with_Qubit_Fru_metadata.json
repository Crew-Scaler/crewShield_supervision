  "summary": "In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm for quantum image representation tailored for neutral-atom quantum devices. The proposed method constructs a qubit-efficient image representation by first applying a cartographic generalization algorithm to a classical edge-extracted input image, yielding a highly optimized sparse-dot based geometric description. While ensuring the structural"
