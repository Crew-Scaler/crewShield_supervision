  "summary": "In this work, we construct new classes of topological black hole solutions in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using a novel model of nonlinear electrodynamics called Modification Maxwell (ModMax) and Modification phantom or Modification anti-Maxwell (ModAMax). We then evaluate the thermodynamic quantities and verify the first law of thermodynamics. Our study examines how the parameters of the ModMax and ModAMax fields, as well as the topological constant, affect the black hole solutions, thermody..."
