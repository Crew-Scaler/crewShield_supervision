  "summary": "Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by ..."
