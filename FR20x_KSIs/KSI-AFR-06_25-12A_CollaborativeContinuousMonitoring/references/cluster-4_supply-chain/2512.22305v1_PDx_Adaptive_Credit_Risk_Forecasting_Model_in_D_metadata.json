  "summary": "This paper presents PDx, an adaptive, machine learning operations (MLOps) driven decision system for forecasting credit risk using probability of default (PD) modeling in digital lending. While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting i"
