  "summary": "Large language models can already query databases, yet most existing systems remain reactive: they rely on explicit user prompts and do not actively explore data. We introduce DAR (Data Agnostic Researcher), a multi-agent system that performs end-to-end database research without human-initiated queries. DAR orchestrates specialized AI agents across three layers: initialization (intent inference and metadata extraction), execution (SQL and AI-based query synthesis with iterative validation), and ..."
