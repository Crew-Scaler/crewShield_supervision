  "summary": "The increasing use of machine learning (ML) for Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction raises concerns about privacy leakage from software analytics data. Existing anonymization methods, such as tabular transformations and graph perturbations, often overlook contextual dependencies among software metrics, leading to suboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs. Leveraging the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a cluster-guided anonymization technique that preserves contextual..."
