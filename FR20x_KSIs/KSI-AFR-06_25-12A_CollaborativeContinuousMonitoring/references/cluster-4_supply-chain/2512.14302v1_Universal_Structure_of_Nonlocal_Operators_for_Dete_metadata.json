  "summary": "We establish a universal geometric framework that transforms the search for optimal nonlocal operators from a combinatorial black box into a deterministic predict-verify operation. We discover that the principal eigenvalue governing nonlocality is rigorously dictated by a low-dimensional manifold parameterized by merely two fundamental angular variables, $\u03b8$ and $\u03c6$, whose symmetry leads to furthe"
