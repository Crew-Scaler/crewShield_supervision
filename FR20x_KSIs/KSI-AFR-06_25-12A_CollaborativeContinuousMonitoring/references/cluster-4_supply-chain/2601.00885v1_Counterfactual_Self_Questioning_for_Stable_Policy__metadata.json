  "summary": "Recent work on language model self-improvement shows that models can refine their own reasoning through reflection, verification, debate, or self-generated rewards. However, most existing approaches rely on external critics, learned reward models, or ensemble sampling, which increases complexity and training instability. We propose Counterfactual Self-Questioning, a framework in which a single lan"
