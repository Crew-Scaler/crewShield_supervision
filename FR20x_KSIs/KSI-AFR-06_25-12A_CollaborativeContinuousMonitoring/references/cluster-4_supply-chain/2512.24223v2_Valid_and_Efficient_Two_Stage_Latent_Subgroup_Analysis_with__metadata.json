  "summary": "Subgroup analysis evaluates treatment effects across multiple sub-populations. When subgroups are defined by latent memberships inferred from imperfect measurements, the analysis typically involves two inter-connected models, a latent class model and a subgroup outcome model. The classical one-stage framework, which models the joint distribution of the two models, may be infeasible with observational data containing many confounders. The two-stage framework, which first estimates the latent clas..."
