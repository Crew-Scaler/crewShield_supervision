  "summary": "Both student retention in higher education and artificial intelligence governance face a common structural challenge: the application of linear regulatory frameworks to complex adaptive systems. Risk-based approaches dominate both domains, yet systematically fail because they assume stable causal pathways, predictable actor responses, and controllable system boundaries. This paper extracts transferable methodological principles from CAPIRE (Curriculum, Archetypes, Policies, Interventions & Resea..."
