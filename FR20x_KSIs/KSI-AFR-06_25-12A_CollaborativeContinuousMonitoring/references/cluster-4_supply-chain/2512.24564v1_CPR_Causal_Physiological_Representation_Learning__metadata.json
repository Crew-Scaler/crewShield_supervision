  "summary": "Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like"
