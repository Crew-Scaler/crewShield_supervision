  "summary": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is fundamental to molecular biology, yet conventional thermocyclers pose significant challenges for emerging applications such as DNA data storage, where full automation, contamination control, and cost-effectiveness are critical. Here, we introduce a disruptive approach that revisits the original water bath-based PCR method and integrates it with modern robotic liq"
