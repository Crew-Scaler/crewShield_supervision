  "summary": "We present an open deep research system for long-form question answering, selected as a winning system in the text-to-text track of the MMU-RAG competition at NeurIPS 2025. The system combines an open-source large language model (LLM) with an open web search API to perform iterative retrieval, reasoning, and synthesis in real-world open-domain settings. To enhance reasoning quality, we apply preference tuning based on LLM-as-a-judge feedback that evaluates multiple aspects, including clarity, in..."
