  "summary": "We construct and validate a set of multi-purpose mock galaxy catalogs designed to capture, to different degrees of accuracy, the main characteristics of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope survey. These catalogs provide a foundation for void statistics and various CMB cross-correlation analyses. Our approach differs from traditional halo occupation or abundance matching methods by directly trans"
