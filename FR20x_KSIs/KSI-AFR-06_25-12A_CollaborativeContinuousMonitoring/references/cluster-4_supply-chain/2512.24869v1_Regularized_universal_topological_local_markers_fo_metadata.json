  "summary": "Local markers provide an efficient and powerful characterization of topological features of many systems, especially when the translation symmetry is broken. Recently, a universal topological local marker applicable in different symmetry classes of topological systems is proposed. However, it suffers from irregular behaviors at the boundary and its connection to other topological indexes remains e"
