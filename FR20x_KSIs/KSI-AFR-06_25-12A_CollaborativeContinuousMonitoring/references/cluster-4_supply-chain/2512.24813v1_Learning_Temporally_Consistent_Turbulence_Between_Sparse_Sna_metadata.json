  "summary": "We investigate the statistical accuracy of temporally interpolated spatiotemporal flow sequences between sparse, decorrelated snapshots of turbulent flow fields using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The developed method is presented as a proof-of-concept generative surrogate for reconstructing coherent turbulent dynamics between sparse snapshots, demonstrated on a 2D Kolmogorov Flow, and a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI). We analyse the generated flow sequence..."
