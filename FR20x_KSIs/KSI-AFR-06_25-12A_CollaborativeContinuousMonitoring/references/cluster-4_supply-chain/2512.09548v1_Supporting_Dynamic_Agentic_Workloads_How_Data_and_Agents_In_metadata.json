  "summary": "The rise of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and specialized reasoning agents exposes fundamental limitations in today's data management architectures. Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, m..."
