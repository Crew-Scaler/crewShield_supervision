  "summary": "We introduce Bitcoin-IPC, a software stack and protocol that scales Bitcoin towards helping it become the universal Medium of Exchange (MoE) by enabling the permissionless creation of fully programmable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Layer-2 chains, called subnets, whose stake is denominated in L1 BTC. Bitcoin-IPC subnets rely on Bitcoin L1 for the communication of critical information, settlement, and security.\n  Our design, inspired by SWIFT messaging and embedded within Bitcoin's SegWit mechanism, enab..."
