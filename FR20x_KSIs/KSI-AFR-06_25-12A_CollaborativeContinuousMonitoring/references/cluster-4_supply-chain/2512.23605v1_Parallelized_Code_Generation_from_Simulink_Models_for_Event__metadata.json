  "summary": "In recent years, the complexity and scale of embedded systems, especially in the rapidly developing field of autonomous driving systems, have increased significantly. This has led to the adoption of software and hardware approaches such as Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 and multi-core processors. Traditional manual program parallelization faces challenges, including maintaining data integrity and avoiding concurrency issues such as deadlocks. While model-based development (MBD) automates this pr..."
