  "summary": "Machine-learning (ML) classifiers are increasingly used in quantum computing systems to improve multi-qubit readout discrimination and to mitigate correlated readout errors. These ML classifiers are an integral component of today's quantum computer's control and readout stacks. This paper is the first to analyze the susceptibility of such ML classifiers to physical fault-injection which can result in generation of incorrect readout results from quantum computers. The study targets 5-qubit (thus ..."
