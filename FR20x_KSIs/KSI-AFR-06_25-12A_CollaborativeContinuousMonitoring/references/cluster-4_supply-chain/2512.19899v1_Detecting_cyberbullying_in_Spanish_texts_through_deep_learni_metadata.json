  "summary": "Recent recollected data suggests that it is possible to automatically detect events that may negatively affect the most vulnerable parts of our society, by using any communication technology like social networks or messaging applications. This research consolidates and prepares a corpus with Spanish bullying expressions taken from Twitter in order to use them as an input to train a convolutional neuronal network through deep learning techniques. As a result of this training, a predictive model w..."
