  "summary": "This work presents the first thorough exploration of how reset operations in cloud-based quantum computers could be exploited to run quantum circuits for free. This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum compu"
