  "summary": "Space exploration has advanced rapidly, but the emotional needs of astronauts on long-duration missions remain underexplored. We present ReHome Earth, a dual-component design approach addressing space homesickness: 1) a future-oriented installation concept integrating transparent OLED displays with spaceship windows for real-time Earth connectivity, and 2) a functional VR prototype simulating astronaut isolation for testing AI-generated content effectiveness. Since accessing astronauts during mi..."
