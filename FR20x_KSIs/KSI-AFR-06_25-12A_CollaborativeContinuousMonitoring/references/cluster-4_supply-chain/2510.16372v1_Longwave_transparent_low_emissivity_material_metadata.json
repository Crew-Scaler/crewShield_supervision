  "summary": "Low emissivity (low-e) materials are crucial for conserving thermal energy in buildings, cold chain logistics and transportation by minimizing unwanted radiative heat loss or gain. However, their metallic nature intrinsically causes severe longwave attenuation, hindering their broad applications. Here, we introduce, for the first time, an all-dielectric longwave-transparent low-emissivity material (LLM) with ultra-broadband, high transmittance spanning 9 orders of magnitude, from terahertz to ki..."
