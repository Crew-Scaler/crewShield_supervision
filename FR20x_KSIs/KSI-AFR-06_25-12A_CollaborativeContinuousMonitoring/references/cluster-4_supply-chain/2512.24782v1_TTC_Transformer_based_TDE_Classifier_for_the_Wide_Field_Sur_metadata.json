  "summary": "We propose the Transformer-based Tidal disruption events (TDE) Classifier (\\texttt{TTC}), specifically designed to operate effectively with both real-time alert streams and archival data of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). It aims to minimize the reliance on external catalogs and find TDE candidates from pure light curves, which is more suitable for finding TDEs in faint and distant galaxies. \\texttt{TTC} consists of two key modules that can work independently: (1) A light curve parametri..."
