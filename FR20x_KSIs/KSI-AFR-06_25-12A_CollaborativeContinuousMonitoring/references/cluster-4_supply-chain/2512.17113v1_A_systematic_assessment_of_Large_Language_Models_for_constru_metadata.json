  "summary": "Two-level fractional factorial designs permit the study multiple factors using a limited number of runs. Traditionally, these designs are obtained from catalogs available in standard textbooks or statistical software. However, modern Large Language Models (LLMs) can now produce two-level fractional factorial designs, but the quality of these designs has not been previously assessed. In this paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of two popular classes of LLMs, namely GPT and Gemini models, to..."
