  "summary": "Biological systems encode function not primarily in steady states, but in the structure of transient responses elicited by time-varying stimuli. Overshoots, biphasic dynamics, adaptation kinetics, fold-change detection, entrainment, and cumulative exposure effects often determine phenotypic outcomes, yet are poorly captured by classical steady-state or dose-response analyses. This paper develops a"
