  "summary": "The protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a critical challenge in contemporary AI research. While fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for detecting unauthorized model usage, existing methods -- whether behavior-based or structural -- suffer from vulnerabilities such as false claim attacks or susceptible to weight manipulations. To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting ..."
