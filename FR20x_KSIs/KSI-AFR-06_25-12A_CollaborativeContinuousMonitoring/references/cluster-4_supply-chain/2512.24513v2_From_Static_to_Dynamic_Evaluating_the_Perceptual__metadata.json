  "summary": "Understanding urban perception from street view imagery has become a central topic in urban analytics and human centered urban design. However, most existing studies treat urban scenes as static and largely ignore the role of dynamic elements such as pedestrians and vehicles, raising concerns about potential bias in perception based urban analysis. To address this issue, we propose a controlled fr"
