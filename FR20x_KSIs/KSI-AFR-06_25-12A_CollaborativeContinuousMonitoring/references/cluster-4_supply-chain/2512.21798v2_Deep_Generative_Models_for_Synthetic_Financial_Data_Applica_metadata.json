  "summary": "Synthetic financial data provides a practical solution to the privacy, accessibility, and reproducibility challenges that often constrain empirical research in quantitative finance. This paper investigates the use of deep generative models, specifically Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate realistic synthetic financial return series for portfolio construction and risk modeling applications. Using historical daily returns from the S..."
