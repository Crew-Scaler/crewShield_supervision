  "summary": "Quantum imaging with undetected light has recently emerged as a technique in which quantum correlations and nonlinear interferometry are combined to decouple illumination and detection paths. This approach has been more recently extended and combined with digital phase-shifting holography and off-axis holography to extract both the amplitude and phase information of a sample relying on single-photon interference. Despite these advantages, implementing the technique in real-world scenarios where ..."
