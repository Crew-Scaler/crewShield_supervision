  "summary": "Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Rea..."
