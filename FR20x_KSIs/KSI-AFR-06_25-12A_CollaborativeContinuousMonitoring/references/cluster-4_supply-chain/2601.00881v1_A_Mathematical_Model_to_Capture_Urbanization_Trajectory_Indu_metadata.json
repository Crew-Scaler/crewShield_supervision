  "summary": "Analysis of the urban population fraction data for sixteen populous countries over the last fifty years reveals a universal increase in urbanization, exhibiting four qualitatively distinct temporal patterns: (i) continuously accelerating growth, (ii) continuously decelerating growth, (iii) two-phase growth transitioning from acceleration to deceleration, and (iv) two-phase growth transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. To understand the origin of these diverse urbanization trajectories,..."
