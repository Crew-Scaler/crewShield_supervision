  "summary": "In randomized controlled trials, ordinal outcomes typically improve statistical efficiency over binary outcomes. The treatment effect on an ordinal outcome is usually described by the odds ratio from a proportional odds model, but this summary measure lacks transparency with respect to its emphasis on the components of the ordinal outcome when proportional odds is violated. We propose various summ"
