  "summary": "The dark sector may possess a rich structure yet to be uncovered, and a QCD-like dark sector with GeV-scale dark hadrons can yield novel signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we focus on a light singlet pseudoscalar mediator that connects the QCD-like dark sector to the Standard Model (SM) sector via the Higgs portal. Notably, when the lightest unstable dark meson has a mass"
