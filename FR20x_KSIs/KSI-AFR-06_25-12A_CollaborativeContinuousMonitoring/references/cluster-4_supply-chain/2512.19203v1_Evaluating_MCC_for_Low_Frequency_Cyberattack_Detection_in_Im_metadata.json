  "summary": "In many real-world network environments, several types of cyberattacks occur at very low rates compared to benign traffic, making them difficult for intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect reliably. This imbalance causes traditional evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, to often overstate model performance in these conditions, masking failures on minority attack classes that are most important in practice. In this paper, we evaluate a set of base and meta classifiers on low-traffic attacks i..."
