  "summary": "High-resolution voxel-based micro-finite element ($\u03bc$FE) models derived from $\u03bc$CT imaging enable detailed investigation of bone mechanics but remain computationally challenging at anatomically relevant scales. This study presents a comprehensive $\u03bc$FE framework for large-scale biomechanical analysis of an intact New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit femur, integrating advanced segmentation, scalable fin"
