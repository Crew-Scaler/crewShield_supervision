  "summary": "We establish an invariance principle connecting boundary random walks on $\\mathbb N$ with Feller's Brownian motions on $[0,\\infty)$. A Feller's Brownian motion is a Feller process on $[0,\\infty)$ whose excursions away from the boundary $0$ coincide with those of a killed Brownian motion, while its behavior at the boundary is characterized by a quadruple $(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)$. This class encompasses "
