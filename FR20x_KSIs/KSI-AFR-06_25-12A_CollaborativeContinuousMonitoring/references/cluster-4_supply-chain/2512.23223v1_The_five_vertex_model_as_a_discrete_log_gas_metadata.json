  "summary": "We consider the five-vertex model on a rectangular domain of the square lattice, with the so-called `scalar-product' boundary conditions. We address the evaluation of the free-energy density of the model in the scaling limit, that is when the number of sites is sent to infinity and the mesh of the lattice to zero, while keeping the size of the domain constant. To this aim, we reformulate the partition function of the model in terms of a discrete log-gas, and study its behaviour in the thermodyna..."
