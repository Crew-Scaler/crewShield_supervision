  "summary": "Personalizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents requires conditioning them on user-specific data, creating a critical trade-off between task utility and data disclosure. While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dep"
