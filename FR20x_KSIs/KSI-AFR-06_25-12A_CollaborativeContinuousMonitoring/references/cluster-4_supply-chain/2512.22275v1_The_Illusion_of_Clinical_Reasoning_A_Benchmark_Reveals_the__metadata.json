  "summary": "Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,2..."
