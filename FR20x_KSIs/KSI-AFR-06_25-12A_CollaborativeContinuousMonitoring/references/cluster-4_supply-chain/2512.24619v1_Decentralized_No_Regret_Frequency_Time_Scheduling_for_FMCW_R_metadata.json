  "summary": "Automotive FMCW radars are indispensable to modern ADAS and autonomous-driving systems, but their increasing density has intensified the risk of mutual interference. Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hoppi..."
