  "summary": "Context. Space weather and its potential negative consequences for life on Earth has received increasing attention in recent decades. Particularly predicting CME onset has become important from a security perspective. To predict CMEs, one must first understand the dynamics leading to pre-eruptive magnetic field configurations such as flux ropes.\n  Aims. In this study, we investigate the realistic formation of coronal flux ropes above the solar photosphere. The aim is to find if and how flux rope..."
