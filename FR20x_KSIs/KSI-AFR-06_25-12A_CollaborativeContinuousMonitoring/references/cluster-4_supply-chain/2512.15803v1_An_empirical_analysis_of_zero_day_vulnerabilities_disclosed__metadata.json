  "summary": "Zero-day vulnerabilities represent some of the most critical threats in cybersecurity, as they correspond to previously unknown flaws in software or hardware that are actively exploited before vendors can develop and deploy patches. During this exposure window, affected systems remain defenseless, making zero-day attacks particularly damaging and difficult to mitigate. This study analyzes the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) vulnerability disclosures reported between January and April 2024, Cole [2025]..."
