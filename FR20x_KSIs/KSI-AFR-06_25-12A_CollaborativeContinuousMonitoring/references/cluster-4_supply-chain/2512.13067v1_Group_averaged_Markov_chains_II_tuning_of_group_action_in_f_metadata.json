  "summary": "We study group-averaged Markov chains obtained by augmenting a $\u03c0$-stationary transition kernel $P$ with a group action on the state space via orbit kernels. Given a group $\\mathcal{G}$ with orbits $(\\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$, we analyse three canonical orbit kernels: namely the Gibbs $(G)$, Metropolis-Hastings $(M)$, and Barker $(B)$ kernels, as well as their multiplicative sandwiches $QPQ$ and the additive mixtures $\\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ where $Q\\in\\{G,M,B\\}$. We show that $M^t, B^t \\to G$ blockwise..."
