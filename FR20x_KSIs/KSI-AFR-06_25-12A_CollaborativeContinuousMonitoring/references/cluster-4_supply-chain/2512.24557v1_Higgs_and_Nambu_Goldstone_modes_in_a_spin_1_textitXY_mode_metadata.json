  "summary": "We theoretically study the collective excitations in a spin-1 $XY$ model with a quadratic Zeeman term and a long-range interaction that decays algebraically with the distance. Using the quantum-field theory based on the finite-temperature Green's function formalism, we analyze properties of the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) and Higgs modes in order to analytically evaluate the damping rate of the Higgs mode in the $XY$ ferromagnetic ordered phase near the quantum phase transition to the disordered phase...."
