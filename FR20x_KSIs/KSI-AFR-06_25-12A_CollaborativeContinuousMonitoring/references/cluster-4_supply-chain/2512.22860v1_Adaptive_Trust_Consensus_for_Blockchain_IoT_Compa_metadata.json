  "summary": "Securing blockchain-enabled IoT networks against sophisticated adversarial attacks remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a trust-based delegated consensus framework integrating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for privacy-preserving policy evaluation, combined with learning-based defense mechanisms. We systematically compare three reinforcem"
