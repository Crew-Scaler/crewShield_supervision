  "summary": "Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues."
