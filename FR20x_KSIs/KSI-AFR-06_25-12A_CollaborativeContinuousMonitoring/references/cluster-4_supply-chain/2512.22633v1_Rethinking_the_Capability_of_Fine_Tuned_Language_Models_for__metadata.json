  "summary": "Learning-based automated vulnerability repair (AVR) techniques that utilize fine-tuned language models have shown promise in generating vulnerability patches. However, questions remain about their ability to repair unseen vulnerabilities. Our empirical study reveals that state-of-the-art models often overfit to the training set and are evaluated using training, validation, and test sets that are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, relying on match-based metrics that compare generated patches to..."
