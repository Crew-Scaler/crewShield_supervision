  "summary": "Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions"
