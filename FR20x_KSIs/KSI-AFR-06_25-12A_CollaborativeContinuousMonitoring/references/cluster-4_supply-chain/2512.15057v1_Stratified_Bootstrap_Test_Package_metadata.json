  "summary": "The Stratified Bootstrap Test (SBT) provides a nonparametric, resampling-based framework for assessing the stability of group-specific ranking patterns in multivariate survey or rating data. By repeatedly resampling observations and examining whether a group's top-ranked items remain among the highest-scoring categories across bootstrap samples, SBT quantifies ranking robustness through a non-containment index. In parallel, the stratified bootstrap test extends this framework to formal statistic..."
