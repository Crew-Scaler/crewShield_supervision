  "summary": "Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an..."
