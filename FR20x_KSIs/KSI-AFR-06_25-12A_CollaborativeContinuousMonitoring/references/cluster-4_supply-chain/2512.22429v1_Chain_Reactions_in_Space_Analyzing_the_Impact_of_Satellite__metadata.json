  "summary": "The exponential increase in artificial satellites, growing from 852 in 2004 to over 9,000 in 2023, has intensified the risk of the Kessler Syndrome: a cascading chain reaction of orbital collisions. This paper analyzes the dynamics of space debris accumulation to identify the primary orbital features contributing to this systemic risk. We compiled and analyzed Two-Line Element (TLE) datasets from Space-Track.org and historical collision data using a Python-based data mining approach. Specificall..."
