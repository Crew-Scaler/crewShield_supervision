  "summary": "The increasing data volume of high-energy space monitors necessitates real-time, automated transient classification for multi-messenger follow-up. Conventional methods rely on empirical features like hardness ratios and reliable localization, which are not always precisely available during early detection. We developed the Lightweight Unified Neural Classifier for High-energy Transients (LUNCH) - an end-to-end deep-learning framework that performs general transient classification directly from r..."
