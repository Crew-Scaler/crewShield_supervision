  "summary": "We present a systematic study of temperature-driven nonaffine rearrangements in a model amorphous solid across the full thermodynamic range, from a high-temperature liquid, through supercooled and sub-glass regimes, into deep glassy states. The central result is a quantitative characterisation of the componentwise nonaffine residual displacements, obtained by subtracting local affine maps from particle displacements. For each state point the tails of the probability distributions of these nonaff..."
