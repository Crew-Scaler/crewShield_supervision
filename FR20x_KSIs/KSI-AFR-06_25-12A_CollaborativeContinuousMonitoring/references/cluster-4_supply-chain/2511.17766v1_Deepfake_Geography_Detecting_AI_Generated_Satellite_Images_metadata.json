  "summary": "The rapid advancement of generative models such as StyleGAN2 and Stable Diffusion poses a growing threat to the authenticity of satellite imagery, which is increasingly vital for reliable analysis and decision-making across scientific and security domains. While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison be..."
