  "summary": "With the rapid development of quantum computing, classical cryptography systems are facing increasing security threats, making it urgent to build architectures resilient to quantum attacks. Although Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology provides information-theoretic security, its limited bandwidth requires it to be combined with classical cryptography-particularly block ciphers such as AES an"
