  "summary": "This work examines the evolution of bar formation in disk galaxies over the last 6 giga-years by analyzing the barred galaxy fraction as a function of key structural parameters. A representative sample of local and distant field galaxies was studied using bar detection techniques based on elliptical isophotes and Fourier decomposition. The analysis focuses on the dependence of bar formation on ste"
