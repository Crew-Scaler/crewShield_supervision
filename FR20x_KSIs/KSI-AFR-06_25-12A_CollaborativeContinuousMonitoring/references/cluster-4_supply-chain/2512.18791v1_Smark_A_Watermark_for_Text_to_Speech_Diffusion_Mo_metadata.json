  "summary": "Text-to-Speech (TTS) diffusion models generate high-quality speech, which raises challenges for the model intellectual property protection and speech tracing for legal use. Audio watermarking is a promising solution. However, due to the structural differences among various TTS diffusion models, existing watermarking methods are often designed for a specific model and degrade audio quality, which l"
