  "summary": "We present MACLA, a framework that decouples reasoning from learning by maintaining a frozen large language model while performing all adaptation in an external hierarchical procedural memory. MACLA extracts reusable procedures from trajectories, tracks reliability via Bayesian posteriors, selects actions through expected-utility scoring, and refines procedures by contrasting successes and failures. Across four benchmarks (ALFWorld, WebShop, TravelPlanner, InterCodeSQL), MACLA achieves 78.1 perc..."
