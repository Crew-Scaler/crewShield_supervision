  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated data extraction and property prediction across materials science, yet their use in superconductivity research remains limited. Here we construct a large experimental database of 78,203 records, covering 19,058 unique compositions, extracted from scientific literature using an LLM-driven workflow. Each entry includes chemical composition, critical temperature, measurement pressure, structural descriptors, and critical fields. We f..."
