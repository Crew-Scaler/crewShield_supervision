  "summary": "In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain..."
