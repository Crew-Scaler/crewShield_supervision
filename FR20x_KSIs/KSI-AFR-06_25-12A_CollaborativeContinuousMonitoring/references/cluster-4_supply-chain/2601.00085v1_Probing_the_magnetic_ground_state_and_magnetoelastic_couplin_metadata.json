  "summary": "Ruthenates, materials with a single magnetic Ruthenium (Ru) atom, often display an exotic array of ground states ranging from superconductivity to altermagnetism. In this work, we investigated the magnetic ground state of a least explored member of the 4d3 double perovskite ruthenate series A2ScRuO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba): Ca2ScRuO6. Interestingly, temperature-dependent bulk susceptibility curve shows ferrimagnetic-like behaviour above the magnetic ordering at around 40 K, which were corroborated by t..."
