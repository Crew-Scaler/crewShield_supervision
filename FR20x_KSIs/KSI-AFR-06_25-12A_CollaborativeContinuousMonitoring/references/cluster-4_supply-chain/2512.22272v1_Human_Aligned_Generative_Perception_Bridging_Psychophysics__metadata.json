  "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guida..."
