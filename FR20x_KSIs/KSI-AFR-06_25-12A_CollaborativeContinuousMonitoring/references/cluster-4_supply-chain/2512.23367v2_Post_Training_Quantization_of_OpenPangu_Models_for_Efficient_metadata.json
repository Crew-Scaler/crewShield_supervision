  "summary": "Huawei's openPangu-Embedded-1B and openPangu-Embedded-7B are variants of the openPangu large language model, designed for efficient deployment on Ascend NPUs. The 7B variant supports three distinct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigms, namely slow_think, auto_think, and no_think, while the 1B variant operates exclusively in the no_think mode, which employs condensed reasoning for higher efficiency. Although CoT reasoning enhances capability, the generation of extended reasoning traces intr..."
