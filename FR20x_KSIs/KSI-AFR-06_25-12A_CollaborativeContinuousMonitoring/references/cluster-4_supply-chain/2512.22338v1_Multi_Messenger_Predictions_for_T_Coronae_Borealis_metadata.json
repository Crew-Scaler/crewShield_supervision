  "summary": "The MAGIC detection of near-TeV gamma-rays from the 2021 outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) has established it as a TeV-scale particle accelerator. However, the underlying production mechanism --\\textit{hadronic} versus \\textit{leptonic}-- remains uncertain due to the non-detection of coincident neutrinos at IceCube. Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS"
