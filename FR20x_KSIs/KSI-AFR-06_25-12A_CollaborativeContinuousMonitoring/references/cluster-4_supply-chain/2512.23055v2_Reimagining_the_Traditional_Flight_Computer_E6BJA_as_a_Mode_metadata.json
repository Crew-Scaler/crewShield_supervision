  "summary": "Traditional flight computers -- including mechanical \"whiz-wheels\" (e.g. E6B, CRP series) and electronic flight calculators (e.g. ASA CX-3, Sportys E6-B) -- have long played a central role in flight planning and training within general aviation (GA). While these tools remain pedagogically valuable, their fixed form factors, constrained interaction models, and limited extensibility are increasingly misaligned with the expectations and workflows of pilots operating in modern digital environments.\n..."
