  "summary": "In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for "
