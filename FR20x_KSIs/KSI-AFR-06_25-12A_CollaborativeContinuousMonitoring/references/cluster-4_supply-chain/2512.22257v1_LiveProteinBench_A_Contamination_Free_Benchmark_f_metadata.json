  "summary": "In contrast to their remarkable performance on general knowledge QA, the true abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks demanding deep, specialized reasoning, such as in protein biology, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Current benchmarks suffer from critical deficiencies, such as data contamination due to outdated test sets, insufficient focus on essential protein-specific tasks, "
