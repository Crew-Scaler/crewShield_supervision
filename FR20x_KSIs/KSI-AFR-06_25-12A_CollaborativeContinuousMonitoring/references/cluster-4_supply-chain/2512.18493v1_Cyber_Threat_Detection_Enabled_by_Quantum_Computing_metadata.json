  "summary": "Threat detection models in cybersecurity must keep up with shifting traffic, strict feature budgets, and noisy hardware, yet even strong classical systems still miss rare or borderline attacks when the data distribution drifts. Small, near-term quantum processors are now available, but existing work rarely shows whether quantum components can improve end-to-end detection under these unstable, resource constrained conditions rather than just adding complexity. We address this gap with a hybrid ar..."
