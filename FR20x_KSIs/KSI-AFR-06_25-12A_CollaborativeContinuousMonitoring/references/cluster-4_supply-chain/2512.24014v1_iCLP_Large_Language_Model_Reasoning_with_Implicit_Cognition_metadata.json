  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring ..."
