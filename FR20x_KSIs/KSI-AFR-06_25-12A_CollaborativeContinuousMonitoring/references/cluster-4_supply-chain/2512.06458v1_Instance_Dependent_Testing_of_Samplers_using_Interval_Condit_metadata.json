  "summary": "Sampling algorithms play a pivotal role in probabilistic AI. However, verifying if a sampler program indeed samples from the claimed distribution is a notoriously hard problem. Provably correct testers like Barbarik, Teq, Flash, CubeProbe for testing of different kinds of samplers were proposed only in the last few years. All these testers focus on the worst-case efficiency, and do not support verification of samplers over infinite domains, a case occurring frequently in Astronomy, Finance, Netw..."
