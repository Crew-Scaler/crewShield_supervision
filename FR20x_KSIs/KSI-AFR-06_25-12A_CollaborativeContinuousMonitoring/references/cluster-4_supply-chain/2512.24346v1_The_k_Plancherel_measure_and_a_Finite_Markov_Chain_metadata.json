  "summary": "Let $\\mathcal{P}_k(n)$ denote the set of partitions of $n$ whose largest part is bounded by $k,$ which are in well-known bijection with $(k+1)$-cores $\\mathcal{C}_k$. We study a growth process on $\\mathcal{C}_k$, whose stationary distribution is the $k$-Plancherel measure, which is a natural extension of the Plancherel measure in the context of $k$-Schur functions. When $k\\to\\infty$ it converges to the Plancherel measure for partitions, a limit studied first by Vershik-Kerov. However, when $k$ i..."
