  "summary": "Traditional flight computers -- including mechanical \"whiz-wheels\" (e.g. E6B, CRP series) and electronic flight calculators (e.g. ASA CX-3, Sportys E6-B) -- have long played a central role in flight planning and training within general aviation (GA). While these tools remain pedagogically valuable, their fixed form factors, constrained interaction models, and limited extensibility are increasingly"
