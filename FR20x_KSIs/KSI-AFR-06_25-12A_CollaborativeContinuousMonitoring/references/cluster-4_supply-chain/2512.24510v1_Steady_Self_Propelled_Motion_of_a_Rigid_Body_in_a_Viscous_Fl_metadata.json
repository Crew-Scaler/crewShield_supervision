  "summary": "We investigate the steady self-propelled motion of a rigid body immersed in a three-dimensional incompressible viscous fluid governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The analysis is performed in a body-fixed reference frame, so that the fluid occupies an exterior domain and the propulsion mechanism is modeled through nonhomogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions at the fluid-body interface. Such conditions provide a realistic description of propulsion in microfluidic and rough-surface regimes, ..."
