  "summary": "Neural Style Transfer (NST) provides a computational framework for the digital preservation and generative exploration of Indonesian batik motifs; however, existing approaches remain largely centered on VGG-based architectures whose strong stylistic expressiveness comes at the cost of high computational and memory demands, that limits practical deployment in resource-limited environments. This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of five widely used CNN backbones, namely VGG16, VGG19..."
