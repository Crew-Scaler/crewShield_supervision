  "summary": "The proliferation of streaming data analytics in data-driven applications raises critical privacy concerns, as directly collecting user data may compromise personal privacy. Although existing $w$-event local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms provide formal guarantees without relying on trusted third parties, their practical deployment is hindered by two key limitations. First, these methods are designed primarily for publishing simple statistics at each timestamp, making them inherently unsu..."
