  "summary": "The development of wearable devices for terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is pivotal for forthcoming 6G Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable optoelectronics. However, existing THz system suffers from bulkiness, narrow spectral response and limited flexibility constrained by their dependence on external antennas, complex coupling architectures and rigid components.
