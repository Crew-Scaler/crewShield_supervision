  "summary": "The expansion of large-scale online education platforms has made vast amounts of student interaction data available for knowledge tracing (KT). KT models estimate students' concept mastery from interaction data, but their performance is sensitive to input data quality. Gaming behaviors, such as excessive hint use, may misrepresent students' knowledge and undermine model reliability. However, syste"
