  "summary": "The integration of data from multiple sources is increasingly used to achieve larger sample sizes and enhance population diversity. Our previous work established that, under random sampling from the same underlying population, integrating large incomplete datasets with summary-level data produces unbiased parameter estimates. In this study, we develop a novel statistical framework that enables the integration of summary-level data with information from heterogeneous data sources by leveraging au..."
