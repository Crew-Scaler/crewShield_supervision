  "summary": "Modern AI inference systems treat transformer execution as mandatory, conflating model capability with execution necessity. We reframe inference as a control-plane decision problem: determining when execution is necessary versus when correctness can be preserved through alternative pathways. We introduce Meaning-First Execution (MFEE), a control-plane architecture implementing this framework, selectively invoking transformer inference only when required. MFEE operates as a gating layer above exi..."
