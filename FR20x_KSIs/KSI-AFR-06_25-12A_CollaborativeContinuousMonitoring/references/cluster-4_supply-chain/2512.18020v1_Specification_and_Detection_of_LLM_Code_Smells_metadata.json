  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained massive popularity in recent years and are increasingly integrated into software systems for diverse purposes. However, poorly integrating them in source code may undermine software system quality. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no formal catalog of code smells specific to coding practices for LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LLM code smells and formalize five recurrent problematic coding practices related to LLM inference in sof..."
