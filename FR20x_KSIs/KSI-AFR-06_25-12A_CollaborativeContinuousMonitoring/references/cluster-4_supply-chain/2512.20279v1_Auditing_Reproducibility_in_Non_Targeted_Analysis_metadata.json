  "summary": "In 2008, melamine in infant formula forced laboratories across three continents to verify a compound they had never monitored. Non-targeted analysis using LC/GC-HRMS handles these cases. But when findings trigger regulatory action, reproducibility becomes operational: can an independent laboratory repeat the analysis and reach the same conclusion?\n  We assessed 103 tools (2004-2025) against six pi"
