  "summary": "We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation of fixed helicity below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state a..."
