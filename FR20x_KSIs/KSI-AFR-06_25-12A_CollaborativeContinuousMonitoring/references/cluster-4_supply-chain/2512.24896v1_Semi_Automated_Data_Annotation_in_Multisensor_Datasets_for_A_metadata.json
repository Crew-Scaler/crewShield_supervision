  "summary": "This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and dura..."
