  "summary": "Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent fa..."
