  "summary": "Routine histology contains rich prognostic information in stage II/III colorectal cancer, much of which is embedded in complex spatial tissue organisation. We present INSIGHT, a graph neural network that predicts survival directly from routine histology images. Trained and cross-validated on TCGA (n=342) and SURGEN (n=336), INSIGHT produces patient-level spatially resolved risk scores. Large indep"
