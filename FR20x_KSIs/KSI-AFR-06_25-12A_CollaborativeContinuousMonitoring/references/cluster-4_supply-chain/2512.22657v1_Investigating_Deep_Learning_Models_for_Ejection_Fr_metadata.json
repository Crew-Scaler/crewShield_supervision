  "summary": "Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to con"
