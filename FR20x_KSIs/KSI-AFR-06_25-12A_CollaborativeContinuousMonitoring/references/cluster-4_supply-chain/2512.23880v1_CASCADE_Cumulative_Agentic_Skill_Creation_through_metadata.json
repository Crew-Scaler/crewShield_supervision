  "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from \"LLM + tool use\" to \"LLM + skill acquisition\". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and cod"
