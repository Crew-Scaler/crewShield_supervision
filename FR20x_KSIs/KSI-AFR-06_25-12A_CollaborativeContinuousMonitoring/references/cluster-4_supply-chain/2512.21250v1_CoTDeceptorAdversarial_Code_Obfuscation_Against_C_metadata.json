  "summary": "LLM-based code agents(e.g., ChatGPT Codex) are increasingly deployed as detector for code review and security auditing tasks. Although CoT-enhanced LLM vulnerability detectors are believed to provide improved robustness against obfuscated malicious code, we find that their reasoning chains and semantic abstraction processes exhibit exploitable systematic weaknesses.This allows attackers to covertl"
