  "summary": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and accurate severity assessment using the Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grading system is critical for clinical decision making. However, radiographic distinctions between early disease stages, particularly KL1 and KL2, are subtle and frequently lead to inter-observer variability among radiologists. To address these challenges, we pro"
