  "summary": "We explore how the physical properties of disc galaxies relate to the presence of bars using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $\u03bb_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, a..."
