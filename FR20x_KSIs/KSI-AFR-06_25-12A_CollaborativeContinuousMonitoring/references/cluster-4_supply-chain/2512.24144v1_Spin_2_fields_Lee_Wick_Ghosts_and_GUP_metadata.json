  "summary": "We revisit the structure of higher-derivative spin-2 theories from the perspective of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We show that a minimal GUP deformation of the Fierz-Pauli (FP) action induces a higher-derivative kinetic operator equivalent, at quadratic order, to the spin-2 sector of Stelle's curvature-squared gravity. Via an auxiliary-field formulation, the GUP-generated higher derivative can be recast as a Lee-Wick (LW) partner of the spin-2. We then demonstrate that the same ..."
