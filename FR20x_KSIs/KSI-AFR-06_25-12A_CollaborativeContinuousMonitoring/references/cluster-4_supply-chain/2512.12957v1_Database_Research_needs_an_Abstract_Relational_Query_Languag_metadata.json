  "summary": "For decades, SQL has been the default language for composing queries, but it is increasingly used as an artifact to be read and verified rather than authored. With Large Language Models (LLMs), queries are increasingly machine-generated, while humans read, validate, and debug them. This shift turns relational query languages into interfaces for back-and-forth communication about intent, which will lead to a rethinking of relational language design, and more broadly, relational interface design.\n..."
