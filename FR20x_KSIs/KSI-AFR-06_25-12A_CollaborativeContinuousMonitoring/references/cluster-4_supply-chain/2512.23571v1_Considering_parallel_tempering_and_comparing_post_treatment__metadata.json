  "summary": "Bayesian profile regression mixture models (BPRM) allow to assess a health risk in a multi-exposed population. These mixture models cluster individuals according to their exposure profile and their health risk. However, their results, based on Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms, turned out to be unstable in different application cases. We suppose two reasons for this instability. The MCMC algorithm can be trapped in local modes of the posterior distribution and the choice of post-treatme..."
