  "summary": "Synchronization systems with effective inertia, such as power grid networks and coupled electromechanical oscillators, are commonly modeled by the second-order Kuramoto model. In the forward process, numerical simulations exhibit a staircase-like growth of global synchrony, reflecting temporal oscillations induced by secondary synchronized clusters of whirling oscillators. While this behavior has been observed previously, its governing conditions have not been quantitatively determined in terms ..."
