  "summary": "The security of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is an important emerging area of research in traffic safety. Methods have been published and evaluated in experimental vehicles to secure safe AV control in the presence of attacks, but human motion comfort is rarely investigated in such studies.\n  In this paper, we present an innovative optimal-coupling-observer-based framework that rejects the impact of b"
