  "summary": "In order to account for reionization of the early Universe, galaxies at that time must have had significantly higher escape fractions of Lyman Continuum (LyC) than observed in the present Universe. Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at $z \\ge 3$ than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing ..."
