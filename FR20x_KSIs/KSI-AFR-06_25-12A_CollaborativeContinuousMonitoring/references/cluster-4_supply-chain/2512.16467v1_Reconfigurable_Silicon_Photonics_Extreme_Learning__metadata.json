  "summary": "An alternative extreme learning machine -ELM- paradigm is presented exploiting random non-linearities -RN, named RN-ELM, instead of a conventional fixed node non-linearity. This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power d"
