  "summary": "This paper introduces constant-size cryptographic evidence structures, a general abstraction for representing verifiable audit evidence for AI workflows in regulated environments. Each evidence item is a fixed-size tuple of cryptographic fields, designed to (i) provide strong binding to workflow events and configurations, (ii) support constant-size storage and uniform verification cost per event, "
