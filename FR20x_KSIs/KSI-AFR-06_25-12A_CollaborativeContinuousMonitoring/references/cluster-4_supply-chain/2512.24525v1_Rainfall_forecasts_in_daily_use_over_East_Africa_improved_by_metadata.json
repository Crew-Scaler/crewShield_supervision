  "summary": "Ensemble forecasting has proven over the years to be a vital tool for predicting extreme or only partially predictable weather events. In particular life-threatening weather events. Many National Meteorological Services in East Africa do not have the computing resources to enable them to run their local area models in full ensemble mode over the full period of the 2 week medium range. As a result, weather users in these countries are not being given sufficient information about weather risk that..."
