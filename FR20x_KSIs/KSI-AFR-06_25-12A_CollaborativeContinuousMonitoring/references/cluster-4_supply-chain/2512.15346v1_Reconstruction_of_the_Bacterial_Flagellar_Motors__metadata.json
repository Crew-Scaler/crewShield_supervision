  "summary": "The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) converts transmembrane ion flux into directed mechanical rotation, driving bacterial motility. Despite extensive study, the frictional forces and energetics governing its torque generation remain poorly understood. Here, we combine single-molecule rotation measurements with stochastic thermodynamics to quantitatively estimate its effective torque, viscous drag a"
