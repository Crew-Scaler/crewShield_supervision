  "summary": "This work presents a survey of mechanical models describing van der Waals interactions between 2D materials, encompassing both continuous elastomer-like materials and discrete (crystalline) 2D materials such as graphene. These interactions give rise to a range of physical phenomena, including contact instabilities, Moir\u00e9 patterns, surface reconstructions, and superlubricity. The underlying contact"
