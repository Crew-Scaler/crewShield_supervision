  "summary": "The Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem remains one of the most fundamental yet computationally challenging tasks in power systems operation and planning due to its nonconvex, nonlinear, and multimodal nature. This paper proposes a convex reformulation of the AC power flow problem by introducing auxiliary variables to isolate nonlinear terms, applying logarithmic transformations"
