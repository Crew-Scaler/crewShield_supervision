  "summary": "Conventional generative models for materials discovery are predominantly trained and validated using data from Density Functional Theory (DFT) with approximate exchange-correlation functionals. This creates a fundamental bottleneck: these models inherit DFT's systematic failures for strongly correlated systems, leading to exploration biases and an inability to discover materials where DFT predicti"
