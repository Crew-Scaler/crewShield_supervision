  "summary": "We investigate whether tools based on large language models (LLMs) can be effectively used by a developer of new perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to predict both the \"lifetime\" of the device and the degree of its degradation at specific time intervals. We demonstrate the ability of common LLM tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and even a simplified free version of ChatGPT) to suggest and justify prediction methods in a dialogue with the user under conditions of incomplete information about the physical mode..."
