  "summary": "Collective motion inspired by animal groups offers powerful design principles for autonomous aerial swarms. We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions betw"
