  "summary": "In this work, we consider general exchangeable quantum mean-field Hamiltonian such as the prominent quantum Curie-Weiss model under the influence of a random external field. Despite being arguably the simplest class of disordered quantum systems, the random external field breaks the symmetry of the mean-field Hamiltonian and hence standard quantum de Finetti type or semiclassical arguments are not"
