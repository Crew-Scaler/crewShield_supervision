  "summary": "The accurate classification of gastrointestinal diseases from endoscopic and histopathological imagery remains a significant challenge in medical diagnostics, mainly due to the vast data volume and subtle variation in inter-class visuals. This study presents a hybrid dual-stream deep learning framework built on teacher-student knowledge distillation, where a high-capacity teacher model integrates "
