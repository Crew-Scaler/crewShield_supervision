  "summary": "We examine the reduction of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) size under an external magnetic field within a classical nucleation theory framework combined with a sphere-packing description of atomic assembly. The model incorporates magnetic free-energy contributions arising from the coupling between the applied field and the magnetic susceptibility of the nucleating material, yielding a closed-form rela"
