  "summary": "Involving deterministically nonlinear photoresponse in on-chip photodetector is intriguing to develop sophisticated functions in photonic integrated circuits, such as in-sensor computing and optoelectronic mixing, though the corresponding devices are still lack of sufficient investigation. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip quadratically nonlinear photodetector (QNPD) by configuring an InSe p-i-n homojunction on a silicon waveguide. Telecom-band light guiding in the waveguide couples with the InSe ..."
