  "summary": "Currently, there exists a fundamental divide between the \"cognitive black box\" (implicit intuition) of human experts and the \"computational black box\" (untrustworthy decision-making) of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper proposes a new paradigm of \"human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement,\" aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible \"functional white-box\" system through structured \"meta-interaction.\" The core breakthrough lies in the \"plug-and..."
