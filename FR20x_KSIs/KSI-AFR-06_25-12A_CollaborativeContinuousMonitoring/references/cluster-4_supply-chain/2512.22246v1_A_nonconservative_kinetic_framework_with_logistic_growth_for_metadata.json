  "summary": "Kinetic theory frameworks are widely used for modeling stochastic interacting systems, where the evolution primarily depends on binary interactions. Recently, in this framework the action of the external force field has been introduction in order to gain a more realistic picture of some phenomena. In this paper, we introduce nonconservative kinetic equations where a particular shape external force field acts on the overall system. Then, this framework is used in an ecological context for modelin..."
