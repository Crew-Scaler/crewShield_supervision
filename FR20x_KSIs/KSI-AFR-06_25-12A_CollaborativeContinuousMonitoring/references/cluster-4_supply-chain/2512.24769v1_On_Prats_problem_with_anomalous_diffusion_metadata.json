  "summary": "The classical Prats' problem of flow instability in a horizontal porous channel saturated by a fluid subject to a buoyancy force is reconsidered. In the original formulation, the driving buoyancy force results from thermal diffusion. This study, however, substitutes thermal diffusion with mass diffusion. Furthermore, the usual scheme of mass diffusion is extended to comprehend also the anomalous phenomena of superdiffusion or subdiffusion. Such phenomena are modelled via a time-dependent mass di..."
