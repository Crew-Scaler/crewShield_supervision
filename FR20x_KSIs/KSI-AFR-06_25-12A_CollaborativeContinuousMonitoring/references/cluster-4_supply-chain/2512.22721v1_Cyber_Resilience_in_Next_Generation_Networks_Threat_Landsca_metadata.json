  "summary": "The evolution of networked systems, driven by innovations in software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), open radio access networks (O-RAN), and cloud-native architectures, is redefining both the operational landscape and the threat surface of critical infrastructures. This book offers an in-depth, interdisciplinary examination of how resilience must be re-conceptualized and re-engineered to address the multifaceted challenges posed by these transformations.\n  Struc..."
