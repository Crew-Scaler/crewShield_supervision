  "summary": "The Gaussian phase approximation (GPA) underlies many standard diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) signal models, yet its validity is rarely scrutinized. Here, we assess the validity of the GPA by analytically deriving the excess phase kurtosis $\u03ba_4/\u03ba_2^2$, where $\u03ba_n$ is the $n^{\\text{th}}$ cumulant of the accumulated phase distribution due to motion. We consider the signal behavior of the spin ech"
