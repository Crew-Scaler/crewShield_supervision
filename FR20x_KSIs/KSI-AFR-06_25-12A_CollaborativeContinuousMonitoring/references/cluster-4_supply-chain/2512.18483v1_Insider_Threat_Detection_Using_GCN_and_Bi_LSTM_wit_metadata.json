  "summary": "Insider threat detection (ITD) is challenging due to the subtle and concealed nature of malicious activities performed by trusted users. This paper proposes a post-hoc ITD framework that integrates explicit and implicit graph representations with temporal modelling to capture complex user behaviour patterns. An explicit graph is constructed using predefined organisational rules to model direct rel"
