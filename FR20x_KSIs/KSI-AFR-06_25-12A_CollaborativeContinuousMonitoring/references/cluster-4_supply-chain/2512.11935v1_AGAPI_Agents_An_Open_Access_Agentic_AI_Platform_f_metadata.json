  "summary": "Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific discovery, yet its use in materials research remains limited by fragmented computational ecosystems, reproducibility challenges, and dependence on commercial large language models (LLMs). Here we introduce AGAPI (AtomGPT.org API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science AP"
