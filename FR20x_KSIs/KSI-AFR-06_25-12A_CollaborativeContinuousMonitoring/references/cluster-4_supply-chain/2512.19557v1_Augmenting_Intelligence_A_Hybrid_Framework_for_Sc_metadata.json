  "summary": "Current approaches to Explainable AI (XAI) face a \"Scalability-Stability Dilemma.\" Post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME, SHAP) may scale easily but suffer from instability, while supervised explanation frameworks (e.g., TED) offer stability but require prohibitive human effort to label every training instance. This paper proposes a Hybrid LRR-TED framework that addresses this dilemma through a novel \"Asym"
