  "summary": "The article discusses a key reconciliation protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) systems based on Tree Parity Machines (TPM). The idea of transforming key material into neural network weights is presented. Two experiments were conducted to study how the number of synchronization iterations and the amount of leaked information depend on the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the range of neural network weights. The results show a direct relationship between the average number of synchronizat..."
