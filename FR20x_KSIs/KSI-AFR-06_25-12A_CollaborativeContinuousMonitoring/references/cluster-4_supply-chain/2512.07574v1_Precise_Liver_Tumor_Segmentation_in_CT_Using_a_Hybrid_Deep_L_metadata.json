  "summary": "Accurate three-dimensional delineation of liver tumors on contrast-enhanced CT is a prerequisite for treatment planning, navigation and response assessment, yet manual contouring is slow, observer-dependent and difficult to standardise across centres. Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couple..."
