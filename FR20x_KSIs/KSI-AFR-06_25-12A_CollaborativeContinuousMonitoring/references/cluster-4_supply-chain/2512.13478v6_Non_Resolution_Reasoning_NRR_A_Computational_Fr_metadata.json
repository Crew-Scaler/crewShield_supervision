  "summary": "Current AI systems exhibit a fundamental limitation: they resolve ambiguity prematurely. This premature semantic collapse--collapsing multiple valid interpretations into single outputs--stems from classical identity assumptions in neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), treating ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode. NRR introduces three principles: (1) Non-Identit"
