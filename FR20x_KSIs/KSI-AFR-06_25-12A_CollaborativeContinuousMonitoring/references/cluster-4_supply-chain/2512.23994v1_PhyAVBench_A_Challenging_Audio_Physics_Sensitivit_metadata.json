  "summary": "Text-to-audio-video (T2AV) generation underpins a wide range of applications demanding realistic audio-visual content, including virtual reality, world modeling, gaming, and filmmaking. However, existing T2AV models remain incapable of generating physically plausible sounds, primarily due to their limited understanding of physical principles. To situate current research progress, we present PhyAVB"
