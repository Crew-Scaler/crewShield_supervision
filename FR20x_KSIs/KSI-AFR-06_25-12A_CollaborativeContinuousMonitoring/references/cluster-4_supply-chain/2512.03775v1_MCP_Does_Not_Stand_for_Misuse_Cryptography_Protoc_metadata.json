  "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as the middleware for LLM-based applications, offering a standardized interface for tool integration. However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc"
