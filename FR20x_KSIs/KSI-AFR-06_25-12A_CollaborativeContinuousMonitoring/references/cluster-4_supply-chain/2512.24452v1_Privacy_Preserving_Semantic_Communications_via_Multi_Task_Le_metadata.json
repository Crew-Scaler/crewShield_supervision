  "summary": "Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The..."
