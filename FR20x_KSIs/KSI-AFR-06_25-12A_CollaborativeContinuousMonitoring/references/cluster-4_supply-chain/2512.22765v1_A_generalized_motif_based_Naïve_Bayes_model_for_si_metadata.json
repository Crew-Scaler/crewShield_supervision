  "summary": "Signed networks, encoding both positive and negative interactions, are essential for modeling complex systems in social and financial domains. Sign prediction, which infers the sign of a target link, has wide-ranging practical applications. Traditional motif-based Na\u00efve Bayes models assume that all neighboring nodes contribute equally to a target link's sign, overlooking the heterogeneous influenc"
