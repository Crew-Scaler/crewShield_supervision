  "summary": "Medical imaging is essential for clinical diagnosis, yet real-world data frequently suffers from corruption, noise, and potential tampering, challenging the reliability of AI-assisted interpretation. Conventional reconstruction techniques prioritize pixel-level recovery and may produce visually plausible outputs while compromising anatomical fidelity, an issue that can directly impact clinical out"
