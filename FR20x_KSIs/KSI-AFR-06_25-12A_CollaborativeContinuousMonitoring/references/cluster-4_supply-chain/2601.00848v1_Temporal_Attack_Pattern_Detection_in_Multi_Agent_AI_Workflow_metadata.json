  "summary": "We present an openly documented methodology for fine-tuning language models to detect temporal attack patterns in multi-agent AI workflows using OpenTelemetry trace analysis. We curate a dataset of 80,851 examples from 18 public cybersecurity sources and 35,026 synthetic OpenTelemetry traces. We apply iterative QLoRA fine-tuning on resource-constrained ARM64 hardware (NVIDIA DGX Spark) through three training iterations with strategic augmentation. Our custom benchmark accuracy improves from 42.8..."
