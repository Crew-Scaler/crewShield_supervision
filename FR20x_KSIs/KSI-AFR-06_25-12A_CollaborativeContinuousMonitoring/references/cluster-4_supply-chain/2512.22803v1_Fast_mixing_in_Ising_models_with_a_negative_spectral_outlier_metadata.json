  "summary": "We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics for Ising models in which the interaction matrix contains a single negative spectral outlier. This class includes the anti-ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on expander graphs, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with disorder of negative mean. Existing approaches to rapid mixing rely crucially on log-concavity or spectral width bounds and therefore can break down in the presence of a negative outlier.\n  To address ..."
