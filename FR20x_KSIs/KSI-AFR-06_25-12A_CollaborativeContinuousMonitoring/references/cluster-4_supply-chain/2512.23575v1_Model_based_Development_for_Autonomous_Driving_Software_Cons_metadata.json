  "summary": "In recent years, autonomous vehicles have attracted attention as one of the solutions to various social problems. However, autonomous driving software requires real-time performance as it considers a variety of functions and complex environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a parallelization method for autonomous driving software using the Model-Based Development (MBD) process. The proposed method extends the existing Model-Based Parallelizer (MBP) method to facilitate the implementation of c..."
