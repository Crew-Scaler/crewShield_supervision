  "summary": "We investigate the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a nominally undoped GaAs/Al$_{0.35}$Ga$_{0.65}$As quantum well using two complementary experimental approaches: time-resolved Kerr rotation and optical orientation measurements of photoluminescence. Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $\u03bc$K is measured..."
