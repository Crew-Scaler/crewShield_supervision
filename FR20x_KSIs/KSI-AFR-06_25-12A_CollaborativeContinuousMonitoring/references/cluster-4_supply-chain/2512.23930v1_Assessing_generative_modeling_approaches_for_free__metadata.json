  "summary": "The accurate estimation of free energy differences between two states is a long-standing challenge in molecular simulations. Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bri"
