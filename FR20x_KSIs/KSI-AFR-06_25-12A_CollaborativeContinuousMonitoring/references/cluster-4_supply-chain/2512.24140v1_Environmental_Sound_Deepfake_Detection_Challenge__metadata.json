  "summary": "Recent progress in audio generation models has made it possible to create highly realistic and immersive soundscapes, which are now widely used in film and virtual-reality-related applications. However, these audio generators also raise concerns about potential misuse, such as producing deceptive audio for fabricated videos or spreading misleading information. Therefore, it is essential to develop"
