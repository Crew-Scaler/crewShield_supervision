  "summary": "With the rapid expansion of data lakes storing health data and hosting AI algorithms, a prominent concern arises: how safe is it to export machine learning models from these data lakes? In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfi..."
