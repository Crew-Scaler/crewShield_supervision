  "summary": "The increasing use of 3D imaging technologies in biological sciences is generating vast repositories of anatomical data, yet significant barriers prevent this data from reaching its full potential in educational and collaborative contexts. While sharing raw CT and MRI scans has become routine, distributing value-added segmented datasets, where anatomical structures are precisely labeled and deline"
