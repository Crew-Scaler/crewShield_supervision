  "summary": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in populatio"
