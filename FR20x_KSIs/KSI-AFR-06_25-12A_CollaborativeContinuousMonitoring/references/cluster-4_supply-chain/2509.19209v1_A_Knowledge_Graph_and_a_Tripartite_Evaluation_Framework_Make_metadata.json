  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced conversational Artificial Intelligence(AI) chatbots; however, domain-specific accuracy and the avoidance of factual inconsistencies remain pressing challenges, particularly for large datasets. Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and evaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a knowledge graph and vector search ret..."
