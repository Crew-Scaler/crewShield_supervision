  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for large-scale extraction and organization of unstructured data owing to their exceptional Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. Empowering materials design, vast amounts of data from experiments and simulations are scattered across numerous scientific publications, but high-quality experimental databases are scarce. This study considers the effectiveness and practicality of five representative AI tools (ChemDataExtractor, BERT-PS..."
