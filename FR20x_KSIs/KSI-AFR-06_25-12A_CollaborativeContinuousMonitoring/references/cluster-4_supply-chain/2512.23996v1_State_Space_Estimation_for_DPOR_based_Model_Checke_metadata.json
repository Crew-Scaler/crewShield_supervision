  "summary": "We study the estimation problem for concurrent programs: given a bounded program $P$, estimate the number of Mazurkiewicz trace-equivalence classes induced by its interleavings. This quantity informs two practical questions for enumeration-based model checking: how long a model checking run is likely to take, and what fraction of the search space has been covered so far. We first show the counting"
