  "summary": "AI data-center expansion is increasingly constrained by the coupled availability of deliverable electricity and heat-rejection (cooling) capacity. We propose and evaluate an integrated Waste-to-Energy-AI Data Center configuration that treats cooling as a first-class energy service rather than an unavoidable electricity burden. The coupled system is modeled as an input-output 'black box' with trans"
