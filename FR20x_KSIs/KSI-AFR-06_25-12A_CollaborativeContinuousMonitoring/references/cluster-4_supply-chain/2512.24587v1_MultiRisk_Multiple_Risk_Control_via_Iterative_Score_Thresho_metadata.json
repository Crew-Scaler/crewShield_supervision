  "summary": "As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that lev..."
