  "summary": "Affective artificial intelligence has made substantial advances in recent years; yet two critical issues persist, particularly in sensitive applications. First, these systems frequently operate as 'black boxes', leaving their decision-making processes opaque. Second, audit logs often lack reliability, as the entity operating the system may alter them. In this work, we introduce the concept of Immu"
