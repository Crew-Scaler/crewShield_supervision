  "summary": "We present a semi-analytical framework to compute the suspension stress in dilute particle-laden non-Newtonian fluids, separating Newtonian and non-Newtonian contributions. The ensemble-averaged stress includes both the particle-induced non-Newtonian stress (PINNS) and an interaction stresslet arising from surface tractions due to the non-Newtonian stress and its induced Newtonian flow. Using a generalized reciprocal theorem, we express this interaction stresslet entirely in terms of the non-New..."
