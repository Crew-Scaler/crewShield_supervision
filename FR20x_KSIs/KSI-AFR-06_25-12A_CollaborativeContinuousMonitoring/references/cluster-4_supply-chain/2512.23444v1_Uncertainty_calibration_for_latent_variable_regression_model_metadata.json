  "summary": "Uncertainty quantification is essential for scientific analysis, as it allows for the evaluation and interpretation of variability and reliability in complex systems and datasets. In their original form, multivariate statistical regression models (partial least-squares regression, PLS, principal component regression, PCR) along with their kernelized versions (kernel partial least-squares regression, K-PLS, kernel principal component regression, K-PCR), do not incorporate uncertainty quantificati..."
