  "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not in"
