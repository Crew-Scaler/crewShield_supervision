  "summary": "Predicting relative risk (RR) of spatial clusters is a complex task in public health that can be achieved through various statistical and machine-learning methods for different time intervals. However, high-resolution longitudinal data is often unavailable to successfully apply such methods. The goal of the present study is to further develop and test a new methodology proposed in our previous wor"
