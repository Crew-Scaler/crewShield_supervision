  "summary": "As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constrain"
