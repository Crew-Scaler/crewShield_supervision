  "summary": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with survival strongly dependent on early detection. Standard-dose computed tomography (CT) screening using the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) standardizes pulmonary nodule assessment but is limited by inter-reader variability and reliance on qualitative descriptors, while radiomics offers quantitative"
