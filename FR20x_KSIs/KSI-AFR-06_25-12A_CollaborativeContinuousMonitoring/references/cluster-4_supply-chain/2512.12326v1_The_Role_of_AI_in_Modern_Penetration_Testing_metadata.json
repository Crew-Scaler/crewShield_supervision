  "summary": "Penetration testing is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, traditionally driven by manual, time-intensive processes. As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress..."
