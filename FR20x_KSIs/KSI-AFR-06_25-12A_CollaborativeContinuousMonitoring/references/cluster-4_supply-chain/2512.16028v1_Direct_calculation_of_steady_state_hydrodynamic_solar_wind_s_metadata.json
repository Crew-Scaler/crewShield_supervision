  "summary": "Steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are known to admit solutions that are singular at the sonic point. Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inc..."
