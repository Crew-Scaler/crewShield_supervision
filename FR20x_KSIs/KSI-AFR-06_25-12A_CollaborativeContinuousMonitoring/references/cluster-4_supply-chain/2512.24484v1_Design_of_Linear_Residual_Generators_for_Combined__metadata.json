  "summary": "A systematic method for the design of linear residual generators for combined fault detection and estimation in nonlinear systems is developed. The proposed residual generator is a linear functional observer built for an extended system that incorporates the fault dynamics from a linear exo-system, and in addition possesses disturbance-decoupling properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for"
