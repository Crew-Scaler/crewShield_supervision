  "summary": "This paper addresses an open inverse problem at the interface of mathematical analysis and spatial ecology: the unique identification of unknown spatial anomalies -- interpreted as zones of habitat degradation -- and their associated ecological parameters in multi-species predator-prey systems with multiple chemical signals, using only boundary measurements. We formulate the problem as the simulta"
