  "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, reducing hallucinations and compensating for outdated information. However, recent studies have exposed a critical vulnerability in RAG pipelines corpus poisoning where adversaries inject malicious documents into the retrieval corpus to manipulate model outputs."
