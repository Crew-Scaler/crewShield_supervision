  "summary": "In modern digital marketing, the growing complexity of advertisement data demands intelligent systems capable of understanding semantic relationships among products, audiences, and advertising content. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Knowledge Graph and Deep Learning-Based Semantic Recommendation Database System (KGSR-ADS) for advertisement retrieval and personalization. The proposed framework integrates a heterogeneous Ad-Knowledge Graph (Ad-KG) that captures multi-relational s..."
