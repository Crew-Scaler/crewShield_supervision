  "summary": "With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we pr..."
