  "summary": "The Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides time stamped vessel positions and kinematic reports that enable maritime authorities to monitor traffic. We consider the problem of relabeling AIS trajectories when vessel identifiers are missing, focusing on a challenging nationwide setting in which tracks are heavily downsampled and span diverse operating environments across continental U.S. waters. We propose a hybrid pipeline that first applies a physics-based screening step to project activ..."
