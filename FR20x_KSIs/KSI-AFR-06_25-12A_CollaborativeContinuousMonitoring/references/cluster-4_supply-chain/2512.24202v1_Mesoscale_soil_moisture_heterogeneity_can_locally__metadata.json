  "summary": "Soil moisture is a key ingredient of humid heat through supplying moisture and modifying boundary layer properties. Soil moisture heterogeneity due to e.g., antecedent rainfall, can strongly influence weather patterns; yet, its effect on humid heat is poorly understood. Idealized numerical simulations are performed with a cloud-resolving ($\u0394x$=500 m), coupled land-atmosphere model wherein wet patc"
