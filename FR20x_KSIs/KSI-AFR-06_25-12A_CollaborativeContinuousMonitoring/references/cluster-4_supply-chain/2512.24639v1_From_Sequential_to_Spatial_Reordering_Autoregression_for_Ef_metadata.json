  "summary": "Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observat..."
