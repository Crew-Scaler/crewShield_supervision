  "summary": "We present a new determination of the strong coupling constant $\u03b1_s$ from a global QCD analysis CT25 of parton distribution functions (PDFs) that incorporates high-precision experimental measurements from the Run-2 of the Large Hadron Collider together with a large sample of other measurements over a wide interval of energies. This work addresses two objectives: providing an up-to-date determination of $\u03b1_s$ using NNLO calculations and a sensitive nucleon data set within a self-consistent framew..."
