  "summary": "The localization of code hallucinations aims to identify specific lines of code containing hallucinations, helping developers to improve the reliability of AI-generated code more efficiently. Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucin"
