  "summary": "We develop an exact electrostatic formulation for a finite-length conducting cylindrical shell of finite thickness separating two dielectric media with arbitrary permittivity contrast. The boundary-value problem is reduced to a coupled system of singular integral equations with elliptic kernels governing the induced surface-charge densities on the inner and outer faces. High-accuracy numerical sol"
