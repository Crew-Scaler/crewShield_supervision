  "summary": "Uncertainties in the high-dimensional space of material parameters pose challenges for the predictive modeling of bcc single crystals, especially under extreme loading conditions. In this work, we identify the key physical assumptions and associated uncertainties in constitutive models that describe the deformation behavior of bcc single crystal molybdenum subjected to quasi-static to shock loading conditions. We employ two representative physics-based bcc single crystal plasticity models taken ..."
