  "summary": "Twisted String Actuators (TSAs) are widely used in robotics but suffer from a limited range of Transmission Ratio (TR) variation, restricting their efficiency under varying loads.To overcome this, we propose a novel lightweight, simple-structured Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) mechanism for TSA utilizing Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) superelasticity. The CVT mechanism consists solely of a pair of highly lightweight superelastic SMA rods connecting the ends of twisted strings. These rods def..."
