  "summary": "Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\u03b1$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\u03b2$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\u03b1/\u03b2$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected..."
