  "summary": "Optimal growth of structures governed by spatially stochastic dynamics arises in many scientific settings, for example in processes such as solution-based crystallization and the formation of microbial biofilms on patterned substrates or microfluidic networks. In this work, we investigate lattice growth using a two-dimensional, zero-temperature stochastic model of short-range spin interactions. Ou"
