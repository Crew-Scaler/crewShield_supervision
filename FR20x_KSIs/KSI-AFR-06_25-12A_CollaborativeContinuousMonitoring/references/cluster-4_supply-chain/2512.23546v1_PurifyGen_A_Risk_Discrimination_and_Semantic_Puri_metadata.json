  "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Purify"
