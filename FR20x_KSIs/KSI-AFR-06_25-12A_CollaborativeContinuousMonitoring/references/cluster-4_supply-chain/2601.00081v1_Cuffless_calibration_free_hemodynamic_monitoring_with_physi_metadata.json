  "summary": "Wearable technologies have the potential to transform ambulatory and at-home hemodynamic monitoring by providing continuous assessments of cardiovascular health metrics and guiding clinical management. However, existing cuffless wearable devices for blood pressure (BP) monitoring often rely on methods lacking theoretical foundations, such as pulse wave analysis or pulse arrival time, making them vulnerable to physiological and experimental confounders that undermine their accuracy and clinical u..."
