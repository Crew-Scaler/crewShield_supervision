  "summary": "Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations in existing featurization methods. More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-trainin..."
