  "summary": "We investigate model reduction of parametric linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. When posed in the frequency domain, this problem can be formulated as seeking a low-order rational function approximation of a high-order rational function. We propose to use a standard reduced basis method (RBM) to construct this low-order rational function. Algorithmically, this procedure is an iterative "
