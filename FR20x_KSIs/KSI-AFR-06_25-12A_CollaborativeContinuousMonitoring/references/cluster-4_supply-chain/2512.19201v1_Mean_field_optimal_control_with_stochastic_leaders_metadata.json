  "summary": "We consider interacting agent systems with a large number of stochastic agents (or particles) influenced by a fixed number of external stochastic lead agents. Such examples arise, for example in models of opinion dynamics, where a small number of leaders (influencers) can steer the behaviour of a large population of followers. In this context, we study a partial mean-field limit where the number of followers tends to infinity, while the number of leaders stays constant. The partial mean-field li..."
