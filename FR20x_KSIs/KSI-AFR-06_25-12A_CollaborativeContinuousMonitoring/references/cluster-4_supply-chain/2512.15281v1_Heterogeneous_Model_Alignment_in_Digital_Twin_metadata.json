  "summary": "Digital twin (DT) technology integrates heterogeneous data and models, along with semantic technologies to create multi-layered digital representation of physical systems. DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing metho..."
