  "summary": "As AI agents increasingly operate in real-world, multi-agent environments, ensuring reliable and context-aware privacy in agent communication is critical, especially to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. Traditional access controls are insufficient, as privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may use information in ways that compromise privacy, such as messaging humans, sharing context with other agents, making tool calls, persisting data, or generating derived privat..."
