  "summary": "The maintenance of rail vehicles and infrastructure plays a critical role in reducing delays, preventing malfunctions, and ensuring the economic efficiency of rail transportation companies. Predictive maintenance systems powered by supervised machine learning offer a promising approach by detecting failures before they occur, reducing unscheduled downtime, and improving operational efficiency. However, the success of such systems depends on high quality labeled data, necessitating user centered ..."
