  "summary": "Advanced nuclear reactor systems face increasing cybersecurity threats as sophisticated attackers exploit cyber-physical interfaces to manipulate control systems while evading traditional IT security measures. This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of artificial intelligence approaches for cybersecurity protection in nuclear infrastructure, using Argonne National Laboratory's Mechanisms Engineering Test Loop (METL) as an experimental platform. We developed a systematic evaluation fram..."
