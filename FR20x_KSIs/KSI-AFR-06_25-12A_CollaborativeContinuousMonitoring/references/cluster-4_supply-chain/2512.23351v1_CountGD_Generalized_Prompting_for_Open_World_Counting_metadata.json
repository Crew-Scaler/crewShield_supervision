  "summary": "The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt..."
