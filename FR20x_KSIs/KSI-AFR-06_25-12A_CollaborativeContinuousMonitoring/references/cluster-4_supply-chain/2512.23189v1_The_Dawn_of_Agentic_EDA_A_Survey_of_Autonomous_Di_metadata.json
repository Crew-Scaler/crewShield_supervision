  "summary": "This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the integration of Generative AI and Agentic AI within the field of Digital Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The paper first reviews the paradigmatic evolution from traditional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to AI-assisted EDA (AI4EDA), and finally to the emerging AI-Native and Agentic design paradigms. We detail the application of these paradigms a"
