  "summary": "Machine learning improves predictive accuracy in insurance pricing but exacerbates trade-offs between competing fairness criteria across different discrimination measures, challenging regulators and insurers to reconcile profitability with equitable outcomes. While existing fairness-aware models offer partial solutions under GLM and XGBoost estimation methods, they remain constrained by single-objective optimization, failing to holistically navigate a conflicting landscape of accuracy, group fai..."
