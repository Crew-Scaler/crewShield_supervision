  "summary": "Open-source libraries are widely used by software developers to speed up the development of products, however, they can introduce security vulnerabilities, leading to incidents like Log4Shell. With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the..."
