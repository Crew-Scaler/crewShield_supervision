  "summary": "This paper presents an empirical investigation into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform automated Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) policy mining. While ABAC provides fine-grained, context-aware access management, the increasing number and complexity of access policies can make their formulation and evaluation rather challenging. To address the task of synthesizing concise yet accurate policies, we evaluate the performance of some of the state-of-the-art LLMs, specifi..."
