  "summary": "Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial and geometric relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models perform well across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to capture structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates executable visual construction into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. Rather than relying solely on textual chains of thought, FIGR externa..."
