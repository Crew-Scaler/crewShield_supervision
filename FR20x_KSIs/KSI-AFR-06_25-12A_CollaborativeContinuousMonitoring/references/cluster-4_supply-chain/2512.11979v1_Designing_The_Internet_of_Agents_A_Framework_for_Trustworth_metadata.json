  "summary": "The rise of generative and autonomous agents marks a fundamental shift in computing, demanding a rethinking of how humans collaborate with probabilistic, partially autonomous systems. We present the Human-AI-Experience (HAX) framework, a comprehensive, three-phase approach that establishes design foundations for trustworthy, transparent, and collaborative agentic interaction. HAX integrates behavioral heuristics, a schema-driven SDK enforcing structured and safe outputs, and a behavioral proxy c..."
