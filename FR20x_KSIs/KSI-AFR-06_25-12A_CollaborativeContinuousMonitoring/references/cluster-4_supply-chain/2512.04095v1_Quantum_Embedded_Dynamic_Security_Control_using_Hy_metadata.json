  "summary": "Dynamic security control (DSC) is considered a pivotal step for the future power grid, which is increasingly penetrated by inverter-based resources. However, the efficiency of such practices, whether governed by automatic generation control or virtual inertia scheduling, can be intractable due to the complexity of the problem and the need to solve the differentialalgebraic equation in a timely man"
