  "summary": "The search for ``dark galaxies,'' a key prediction of the lambda cold dark matter, has yielded few viable candidates. Recently, FAST J0139+4328 was reported as the first isolated dark galaxy in the nearby universe, based on a neutral hydrogen (HI) detection and a non-detection in the Pan-STARRS1 survey. To verify the nature of this candidate, we obtained deep optical imaging, using the $1.4\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Milankovi\u0107} and $0.6\\,\\mathrm{m}$ \\textit{Nedeljkovi\u0107} telescopes, and spectroscopic ..."
