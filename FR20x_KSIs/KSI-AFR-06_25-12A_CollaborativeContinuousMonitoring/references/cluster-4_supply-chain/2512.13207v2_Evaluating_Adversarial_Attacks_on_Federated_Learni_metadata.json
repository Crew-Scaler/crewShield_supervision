  "summary": "Deep learning and federated learning (FL) are becoming powerful partners for next-generation weather forecasting. Deep learning enables high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts that can surpass traditional numerical models, while FL allows institutions in different locations to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, addressing efficiency and security concerns. While FL has shown pr"
