  "summary": "Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) represent a promising fusion of quantum computing and neural network architectures, offering speed-ups and efficient processing of high-dimensional, entangled data. A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by tw..."
