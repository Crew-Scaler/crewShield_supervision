  "summary": "The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless technologies is driving an urgent need for large-scale, high-fidelity, and reproducible radio frequency (RF) datasets. Existing resources, such as CKMImageNet, primarily provide preprocessed and image-based channel representations, which conceal the fine-grained physical characteristics of signal propagation that are essential for effective AI modeling. To bridge this gap, we present OpenPathNet, an open-source RF..."
