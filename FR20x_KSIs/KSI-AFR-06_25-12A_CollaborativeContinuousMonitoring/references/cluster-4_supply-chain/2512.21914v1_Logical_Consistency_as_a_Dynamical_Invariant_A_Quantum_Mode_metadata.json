  "summary": "Logical paradoxes and inconsistent information pose deep challenges in epistemology and the philosophy of logic. Classical systems typically handle contradictions only through external checks or by altering the logical framework, as in Tarski's hierarchy or paraconsistent logics. We propose a novel approach: a quantum circuit architecture that intrinsically enforces logical consistency during its unitary evolution. By encoding self-referential or contradictory propositions into a quantum state, ..."
