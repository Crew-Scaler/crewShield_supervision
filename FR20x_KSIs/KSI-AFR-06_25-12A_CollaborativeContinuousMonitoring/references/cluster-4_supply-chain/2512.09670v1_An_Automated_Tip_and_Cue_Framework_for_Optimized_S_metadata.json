  "summary": "The proliferation of satellite constellations, coupled with reduced tasking latency and diverse sensor capabilities, has expanded the opportunities for automated Earth observation. This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery,"
