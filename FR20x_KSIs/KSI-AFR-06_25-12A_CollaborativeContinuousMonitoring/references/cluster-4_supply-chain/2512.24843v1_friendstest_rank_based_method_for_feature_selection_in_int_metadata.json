  "summary": "The analysis of the interaction matrix between two distinct sets is essential across diverse fields, from pharmacovigilance to transcriptomics. Not all interactions are equally informative: a marker gene associated with a few specific biological processes is more informative than a highly expressed non-specific gene associated with most observed processes. Identifying these interactions is challenging due to background connections. Furthermore, data heterogeneity across sources precludes univers..."
