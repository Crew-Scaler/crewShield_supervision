  "summary": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers withou"
