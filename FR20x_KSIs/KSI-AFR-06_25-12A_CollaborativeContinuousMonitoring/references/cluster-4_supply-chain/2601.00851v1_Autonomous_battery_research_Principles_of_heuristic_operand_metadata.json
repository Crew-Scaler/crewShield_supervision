  "summary": "Unravelling the complex processes governing battery degradation is critical to the energy transition, yet the efficacy of operando characterisation is severely constrained by a lack of Reliability, Representativeness, and Reproducibility (the 3Rs). Current methods rely on bespoke hardware and passive, pre-programmed methodologies that are ill-equipped to capture stochastic failure events. Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic..."
