  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in automated software security, particularly in vulnerability detection. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on isolated, single-vulnerability samples or function-level classification, failing to reflect the complexity of real-world software where multiple interacting vulnerabilities often coexist within large files. Recent studies indicate that LLMs suffer from \"count bias\" and \"selection bias\" in multi-label tasks, y..."
