  "summary": "We demonstrate that topological insulators exhibit an intrinsic interfacial instability that amplifies small interface fluctuations, resulting in chaotic behavior during interface growth. This mechanism is fundamentally different from conventional interfacial instabilities in crystal growth that are driven by external non-uniformities such as surface diffusion, and instead arises from intrinsic electronic properties of topological materials. We find that the boundary states of topological insula..."
