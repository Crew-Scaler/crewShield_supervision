  "summary": "We investigate how large language models can be used as research tools in scientific computing while preserving mathematical rigor. We propose a human-in-the-loop workflow for interactive theorem proving and discovery with LLMs. Human experts retain control over problem formulation and admissible assumptions, while the model searches for proofs or contradictions, proposes candidate properties and "
