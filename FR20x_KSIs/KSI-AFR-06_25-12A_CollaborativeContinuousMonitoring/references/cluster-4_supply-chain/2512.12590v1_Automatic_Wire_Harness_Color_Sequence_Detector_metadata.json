  "summary": "Wire harness inspection process remains a labor-intensive process prone to errors in the modern Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) industry. This paper introduces a semiautomated machine vision system capable of verifying correct wire positioning, correctness of the connector polarity and correctness of color sequences for both linear and circular wire harness configurations. Five industrial standard CMOS cameras are integrated into a modularized mechanical framework in the physical struct..."
