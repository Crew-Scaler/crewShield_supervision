  "summary": "Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation models are widely used in real-world systems due to their scalability, real-time capabilities, and high recommendation quality. Research to enhance I2I performance focuses on two directions: 1) model-centric approaches, which adopt deeper architectures but risk increased computational costs and deployment complexity, and 2) data-centric methods, which refine training data without altering models, offering cost-effectiveness but struggling with data sparsity and ..."
