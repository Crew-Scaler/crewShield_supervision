  "summary": "As autonomous vehicle technology advances, ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems becomes paramount. Consequently, comprehensive testing methodologies are essential to evaluate the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. This study focuses on the behaviour coverage analysis of a multi-agent system simulation designed for autonomous vehicle testing, and provides a systematic approach to measure and assess behaviour coverage within the simulati..."
