  "summary": "Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret prese..."
