  "summary": "Timing side-channels are an important threat to cryptography that still needs to be addressed in implementations, and the advent of post-quantum cryptography raises this issue because the lattice-based schemes may produce secret-dependent timing variability with the help of complex arithmetic and control flow. Since also real timing measurements are affected by environmental noise (e.g. scheduling"
