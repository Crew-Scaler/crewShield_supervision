  "summary": "High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare i"
