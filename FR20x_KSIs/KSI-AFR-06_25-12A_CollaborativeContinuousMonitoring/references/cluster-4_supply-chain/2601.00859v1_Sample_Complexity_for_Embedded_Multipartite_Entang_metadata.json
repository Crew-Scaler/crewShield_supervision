  "summary": "Detecting multipartite entanglement in many qubit systems is measurement-intensive, motivating protocols that estimate only selected observables with provable efficiency. In this work we use the classical shadow protocol to study the sample complexity required to estimate a family of subsystem $n$-partite entanglement witness embedded in an larger $N$-qubit system. We derive ensemble dependent var"
