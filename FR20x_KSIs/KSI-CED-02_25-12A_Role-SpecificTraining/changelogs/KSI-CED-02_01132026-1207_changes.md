## Complementary Questions from KSI-PIY-06

Per GitHub Issue #40 refinement, **KSI-PIY-06-Q39 (Organizational Competency & Skill Development)** complements this KSI's training effectiveness focus:

**Q39 Context - AI-Driven Security Operations Training & Hiring:**
Organizations deploying AI-driven security solutions need training and hiring strategies for:
- Training analysts on AI tool usage and limitations (covered in Section 5, Q013)
- ML engineering hiring and specializations for building/maintaining AI detection models
- Incident response drills incorporating AI automation scenarios (covered in Section 6, Q021)
- Certifications and specializations for AI-aware security professionals
- Annual competency assessments and capability gap identification

**Integration Rationale:**
- CED-02 addresses role-specific training effectiveness assessment and content coverage
- PIY-06-Q39 extends this to organizational capability building (hiring, certifications, competency assessment) for AI-driven SOC operations
- Together they provide comprehensive human capability assessment from training to hiring strategy
