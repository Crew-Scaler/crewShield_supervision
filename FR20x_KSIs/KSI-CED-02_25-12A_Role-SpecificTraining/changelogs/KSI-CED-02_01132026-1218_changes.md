# Processing Summary (Removed from Questions)

## Processing Summary

**Previous Refinement (Version 2.0):**
Based on GitHub Issue #12 review feedback (Jan 8-13, 2026), the following refinements were applied to ensure tight focus on training effectiveness for high-risk roles:

- **Questions Removed:** Q13-Q18 (framework laundry lists), Q29, Q32, Q44-Q46 (governance/policy better-suited to other KSIs), Q47-Q49 (research aspirational, not core assessment)
- **Questions Consolidated:** Q7+Q40 (metrics), Q8+Q41 (assessments/dashboards), Q10+Q11+Q12+Q42 (incident-training link)
- **Questions Refined:** Q30 slimmed to focus only on approved vs. prohibited AI tool training; moved policy/monitoring aspects to AI-usage KSI
- **Perspective Removed:** Eliminated CIO/Customer/Auditor role distinctions; questions now perspective-neutral, focused on role-specific training effectiveness
- **Initial Result:** 31 discovery questions (down from 49)

**Task 2 Fine-tuning (Version 2.1):**
Applied Task 2 fine-tuning per GitHub Issue #12 guidance to remove out-of-scope content:

- **Removed Section 10:** Q034-Q039 (Alert Fatigue, Analyst Burnout & Trust Restoration from INR-03)
  - Rationale: While analyst training is important, questions about SOC burnout, alert fatigue, and trust restoration in AI-generated incident recommendations diverge from the core CED-02 scope (role-specific training effectiveness)
  - These topics are better-suited to INR-03 (Incident Response) or MLA-01 (SIEM) KSIs
  - Moved 6 questions to INR-03 for integration into incident response training guidance

**Final Question Count:** 34 discovery questions (down from 39) focused on core training effectiveness assessment for high-risk roles.
