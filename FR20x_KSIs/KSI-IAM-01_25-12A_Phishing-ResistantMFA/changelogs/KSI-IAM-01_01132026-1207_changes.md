**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets
**Research Basis:** 154+ peer-reviewed papers synthesized into 5 thematic clusters emphasizing: AI Agent Identity & Non-Human Authentication (45 papers), Behavioral Anomaly Detection & Continuous Authentication (45 papers), AI-Powered Attacks Against MFA (46 papers), AI Attack Defense & Robustness (51 papers), Biometric Spoofing Defense & Liveness Detection (45 papers). Key findings validated: AI phishing 11% conversion rate (6x traditional, 108-person human subject study), voice cloning from 30-second samples enabling fully automated vishing, deepfake detection accuracy 45-50% worse on real-world vs benchmark data, AitM attacks comprising 79% of MFA bypass incidents, 89% enterprise AI agent adoption with 15-20 service accounts per agent, multi-modal behavioral detection achieving 95-98% accuracy, SPIFFE/SPIRE production-ready with <1 hour token lifetime, zero standing privilege and TBAC enabling AI-agent-specific permission scoping, federated learning enabling privacy-preserving risk assessment, continual learning handling concept drift for long-term model viability.
