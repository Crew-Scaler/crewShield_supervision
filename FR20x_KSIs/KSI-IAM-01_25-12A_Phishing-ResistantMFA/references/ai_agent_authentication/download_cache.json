      "abstract": "GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for web applications, offering a flexible alternative to RESTful APIs. However, its dynamic execution model and lack of built-in security mechanisms expose it to vulnerabilities such as unauthorized data access, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and injections. Existing testing tools focus on functional correctness, often overlooking security risks stemming from query interdependencies and execution context. This paper presents GraphQ",
