#### Securing AI Agent Execution

- **Paper ID:** 2510.21236v2
- **Published:** 2025-10-24
- **Authors:** Christoph Bühler, Matteo Biagiola, Luca Di Grazia, Guido Salvaneschi
- **Categories:** cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.SE
- **Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP servers. AgentBound combines a dec...
