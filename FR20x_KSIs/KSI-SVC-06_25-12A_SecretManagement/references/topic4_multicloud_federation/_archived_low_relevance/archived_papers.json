      "abstract": "Machine learning has become a crucial part of our lives, with applications spanning nearly every aspect of our daily activities. However, using personal information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability. Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for privacy and security application developers. We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption. Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Quantiles are key in distributed analytics, but computing them over sensitive data risks privacy. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers strong protection but lower accuracy than central DP, which assumes a trusted aggregator. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) can bridge this gap, but generic MPC solutions face scalability challenges due to large domains, complex secure operations, and multi-round interactions. We present Piquant$\\varepsilon$, a system for privacy-preserving estimation of multiple quantiles in a distributed setting without relying on a trusted server. Piquant$\\varepsilon$ operates under the malicious threat model and achieves accuracy of the central DP model. Built on the two-server model, Piquant$\\varepsilon$ uses a novel strategy of releasing carefully chosen intermediate statistics, reducing MPC complexity while preserving end-to-end DP. Empirically, Piquant$\\varepsilon$ estimates 5 quantiles on 1 million records in under a minute with domain size $10^9$, achieving up to $10^4$-fold higher accuracy than LDP, and up to $\\sim 10\\times$ faster runtime compared to baselines.",

      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of chiplet-based heterogeneous integration is reshaping semiconductor design by enabling modular, scalable, and faster time-to-market solutions for AI and high-performance computing. However, multi-vendor assembly in post-fabrication environments fragments the supply chain and exposes SiP systems to serious security threats, including cloning, overproduction, and chiplet substitution. Existing authentication solutions depend on trusted integrators or centralized security anchors, which can expose sensitive data or create single points of failure. We introduce AuthenTree, a distributed authentication framework that leverages multi-party computation (MPC) in a scalable tree-based architecture, removing the need for dedicated security hardware or centralized trust. AuthenTree enables secure chiplet validation without revealing raw signatures, distributing trust across multiple integrator chiplets. Our evaluation in five SiP benchmarks demonstrates that AuthenTree imposes minimal overhead, with an area as low as 0.48% (7,000 sq-micrometers), an overhead power under 0.5%, and an authentication latency below 1 microsecond, surpassing previous work in some cases by 700 times. These results establish AuthenTree as an efficient, robust, and scalable solution for next-generation chiplet-based security in zero-trust SiP environments.",

      "abstract": "Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE), proposed by Lopez-Alt et al. (STOC 2012), allows for performing arithmetic computations directly on ciphertexts encrypted under distinct keys. Subsequent works by Chen and Dai et al. (CCS 2019) and Kim and Song et al. (CCS 2023) extended this concept by proposing multi-key BFV/CKKS variants, referred to as the CDKS scheme. These variants incorporate asymptotically optimal techniques to facilitate secure computation across multiple data providers. In this paper, we identify a critical security vulnerability in the CDKS scheme when applied to multiparty secure computation tasks, such as privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL). In particular, we show that CDKS may inadvertently leak plaintext information from one party to others. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new scheme, SMHE (Secure Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption), which incorporates a novel masking mechanism into the multi-key BFV and CKKS frameworks to ensure that plaintexts remain confidential throughout the computation. We implement a PPFL application using SMHE and demonstrate that it provides significantly improved security with only a modest overhead in homomorphic evaluation. For instance, our PPFL model based on multi-key CKKS incurs less than a 2\\times runtime and communication traffic increase compared to the CDKS-based PPFL model.

Thus, its security and robustness is of significant importance. There are many algorithms that provide robustness in the case of malicious clients. However, the aggregator itself may behave maliciously, for example, by biasing the model or tampering with the weights to weaken the models privacy. In this work, we introduce a verifiable federated learning protocol that enables clients to verify the correctness of the aggregators computation without compromising the confidentiality of their updates. Our protocol uses a standard secure aggregation technique to protect individual model updates with a linearly homomorphic authenticator scheme that enables efficient, privacy-preserving verification of the aggregated result. Our construction ensures that clients can detect manipulation by the aggregator while maintaining low computational overhead. We demonstrate that our approach scales to large models, enabling verification over large neural networks with millions of parameters.",

      "abstract": "As AI-driven dataspaces become integral to data sharing and collaborative analytics, ensuring privacy, performance, and policy compliance presents significant challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of privacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, Trusted Execution Environments, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation, alongside strategies for aligning AI with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and the EU AI Act. We propose a novel taxonomy to classify these techniques based on privacy levels, performance impacts, and compliance complexity, offering a clear framework for practitioners and researchers to navigate trade-offs. Key performance metrics -- latency, throughput, cost overhead, model utility, fairness, and explainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization required in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including the lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI for federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory fragmentation. Future directions are outlined, proposing a conceptual framework for policy-driven alignment, automated compliance validation, standardized benchmarking, and integration with European initiatives like GAIA-X, IDS, and Eclipse EDC. By synthesizing technical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives, this work lays the groundwork for developing trustworthy, efficient, and compliant AI systems in dataspaces, fostering innovation in secure and responsible data-driven ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "With the widespread application of edge computing and cloud systems in AI-driven applications, how to maintain efficient performance while ensuring data privacy has become an urgent security issue. This paper proposes a federated learning-based data collaboration method to improve the security of edge cloud AI systems, and use large-scale language models (LLMs) to enhance data privacy protection and system robustness. Based on the existing federated learning framework, this method introduces a secure multi-party computation protocol, which optimizes the data aggregation and encryption process between distributed nodes by using LLM to ensure data privacy and improve system efficiency. By combining advanced adversarial training techniques, the model enhances the resistance of edge cloud AI systems to security threats such as data leakage and model poisoning. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 15% better than the traditional federated learning method in terms of data protection and model robustness.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is susceptible to privacy attacks, such as data reconstruction attacks, in which a semi-honest server or a malicious client infers information about other clients' datasets from their model updates or gradients. To enhance the privacy of FL, recent studies combined Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE) and FL, making it possible to aggregate the encrypted model updates using different keys without having to decrypt them. Despite the privacy guarantees of MKHE, existing approaches are not well-suited for real-world deployment due to their high computation and communication overhead. We propose MASER, an efficient MKHE-based Privacy-Preserving FL framework that combines consensus-based model pruning and slicing techniques to reduce this overhead. Our experimental results show that MASER is 3.03 to 8.29 times more efficient than existing MKHE-based FL approaches in terms of computation and communication overhead while maintaining comparable classification accuracy to standard FL algorithms. Compared to a vanilla FL algorithm, the overhead of MASER is only 1.48 to 5 times higher, striking a good balance between privacy, accuracy, and efficiency in both IID and non-IID settings.",

      "abstract": "To preserve privacy, multi-party computation (MPC) enables executing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on secret-shared or encrypted data. However, existing MPC frameworks are not optimized for sparse data. This makes them unsuitable for ML applications involving sparse data, e.g., recommender systems or genomics. Even in plaintext, such applications involve high-dimensional sparse data, that cannot be processed without sparsity-related optimizations due to prohibitively large memory requirements. Since matrix multiplication is central in ML algorithms, we propose MPC algorithms to multiply secret sparse matrices. On the one hand, our algorithms avoid the memory issues of the \"dense\" data representation of classic secure matrix multiplication algorithms. On the other hand, our algorithms can significantly reduce communication costs (some experiments show a factor 1000) for realistic problem sizes. We validate our algorithms in two ML applications in which existing protocols are impractical. An important question when developing MPC algorithms is what assumptions can be made. In our case, if the number of non-zeros in a row is a sensitive piece of information then a short runtime may reveal that the number of non-zeros is small. Existing approaches make relatively simple assumptions, e.g., that there is a universal upper bound to the number of non-zeros in a row. This often doesn't align with statistical reality, in a lot of sparse datasets the amount of data per instance satisfies a power law. We propose an approach which allows adopting a safe upper bound on the distribution of non-zeros in rows/columns of sparse matrices.",

In this work, we propose a secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based private LLMs watermarking framework, PRIVMARK, to address the concerns. Concretely, we investigate PostMark (EMNLP'2024), one of the state-of-the-art LLMs Watermarking methods, and formulate its basic operations. Then, we construct efficient protocols for these operations using the MPC primitives in a black-box manner. In this way, PRIVMARK enables multiple parties to collaboratively watermark an LLM's output without exposing the model's weights to any single computing party. We implement PRIVMARK using SecretFlow-SPU (USENIX ATC'2023) and evaluate its performance using the ABY3 (CCS'2018) backend. The experimental results show that PRIVMARK achieves semantically identical results compared to the plaintext baseline without MPC and is resistant against paraphrasing and removing attacks with reasonable efficiency.",

To do so, ORQ eliminates the quadratic cost of secure joins by leveraging the fact that, in practice, the structure of many real queries allows us to join records and apply the aggregations \"on the fly\" while keeping the result size bounded. On the system side, ORQ contributes generic oblivious operators, a data-parallel vectorized query engine, a communication layer that amortizes MPC network costs, and a dataflow API for expressing relational analytics -- all built from the ground up. We evaluate ORQ in LAN and WAN deployments on a diverse set of workloads, including complex queries with multiple joins and custom aggregations. When compared to state-of-the-art solutions, ORQ significantly reduces MPC execution times and can process one order of magnitude larger datasets.

These MPC protocols fundamentally rely on Oblivious Transfer (OT), particularly Correlated OT (COT), to generate correlated randomness essential for secure computation. Although COT generation is efficient in conventional two-party settings with resource-rich participants, it becomes a critical bottleneck in real-world inference on resource-constrained devices (e.g., IoT sensors and wearables), due to both communication latency and limited computational capacity. To enable real-time secure inference, we introduce Silentflow, a highly efficient Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-assisted protocol that eliminates communication in COT generation. We tackle the core performance bottleneck-low computational intensity-through structured algorithmic decomposition: kernel fusion for parallelism, Blocked On-chip eXpansion (BOX) to improve memory access patterns, and vectorized batch operations to maximize memory bandwidth utilization. Through design space exploration, we balance end-to-end latency and resource demands, achieving up to 39.51x speedup over state-of-the-art protocols. By offloading COT computations to a Zynq-7000 SoC, SilentFlow accelerates PPMLaaS inference on the ImageNet dataset under resource constraints, achieving a 4.62x and 3.95x speedup over Cryptflow2 and Cheetah, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Publicly available large pretrained models (i.e., backbones) and lightweight adapters for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have become standard components in modern machine learning pipelines. However, preserving the privacy of both user inputs and fine-tuned adapters -- often trained on sensitive data -- during inference remains a significant challenge. Applying cryptographic techniques, such as multi-party computation (MPC), to PEFT settings still incurs substantial encrypted computation across both the backbone and adapter, mainly due to the inherent two-way communication between them. To address this limitation, we propose CryptPEFT, the first PEFT solution specifically designed for private inference scenarios. CryptPEFT introduces a novel one-way communication (OWC) architecture that confines encrypted computation solely to the adapter, significantly reducing both computational and communication overhead. To maintain strong model utility under this constraint, we explore the design space of OWC-compatible adapters and employ an automated architecture search algorithm to optimize the trade-off between private inference efficiency and model utility. We evaluated CryptPEFT using Vision Transformer backbones across widely used image classification datasets. Our results show that CryptPEFT significantly outperforms existing baselines, delivering speedups ranging from $20.62\\times$ to $291.48\\times$ in simulated wide-area network (WAN) and local-area network (LAN) settings. On CIFAR-100, CryptPEFT attains 85.47% accuracy with just 2.26 seconds of inference latency. These findings demonstrate that CryptPEFT offers an efficient and privacy-preserving solution for modern PEFT-based inference.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) involves private data and proprietary model parameters. MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy. Built as an extension to PyTorch 2's compiler, we show that CrypTorch's auto-tuning alone provides 1.20--1.7$\\times$ immediate speedup without sacrificing accuracy, and 1.31--1.8$\\times$ speedup when some accuracy degradation is allowed, compared to our well-optimized baseline. Combined with better engineering and adoption of state-of-the-art practices, the entire framework brings 3.22--8.6$\\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the popular framework, CrypTen.",

Although the existing scheme uses threshold cryptography to mitigate the inference attack, it can not guarantee the verifiability of the aggregation results, making the system vulnerable to the threat of poisoning attack. We construct a partial decryption verifiable threshold multi client function encryption scheme, and apply it to Federated learning to implement the federated learning verifiable threshold security aggregation protocol (VTSAFL). VTSAFL empowers clients to verify aggregation results, concurrently minimizing both computational and communication overhead. The size of the functional key and partial decryption results of the scheme are constant, which provides efficiency guarantee for large-scale deployment. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that vtsafl can achieve the same accuracy as the existing scheme, while reducing the total training time by more than 40%, and reducing the communication overhead by up to 50%. This efficiency is critical for overcoming the resource constraints inherent in Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",

However, existing FL protocols struggle to defend against Byzantine participants, maintain model utility under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and remain lightweight for edge devices. Prior work either assumes trusted hardware, uses expensive cryptographic tools, or fails to address privacy and robustness simultaneously. We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated Learning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure aggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest servers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy leakage through client-server collusion. DSFL introduces three key innovations: (1) a dual-server secure aggregation protocol that protects updates without encryption or key exchange, (2) a group-wise credit-based filtering mechanism to isolate Byzantine clients based on deviation scores, and (3) a dynamic reward-penalty system for enforcing fair participation. DSFL is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in both IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines, including LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy approaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar threats. DSFL remains lightweight, requiring only 55.9 ms runtime and 1088 KB communication per round.",

      "abstract": "Distributed Key Generation (DKG) underpins threshold cryptography in many systems, including decentralized wallets, validator key ceremonies, cross-chain bridges, threshold signatures, secure multiparty computation, and internet voting. Classical ($t$,$n$)-DKG assumes a fixed group of n parties and a global threshold $t$, requiring full and timely participation. When actual participation deviates, the setup must abort or restart, which is impractical in open or time-critical environments where $n$ is large and availability unpredictable. We introduce Federated Distributed Key Generation (FDKG), inspired by Federated Byzantine Agreement, that makes participation optional and trust heterogeneous. Each participant selects a personal guardian set $G_i$ of size $k$ and a local threshold $t$. Its partial secret can later be reconstructed either by itself or by any t of its guardians. FDKG generalizes PVSS-based DKG and completes both generation and reconstruction in a single broadcast round each, with total communication proportional to $n k$ and at most $O(n^2)$ for reconstruction. Our analysis shows that (i) generation ensures correctness, privacy, and robustness under standard PVSS-based DKG assumptions, and (ii) reconstruction provides liveness and privacy characterized by the guardian-set topology {$G_i$}. Liveness holds if no participant $i$ is corrupted together with at least $k-t+1$ of its guardians. Conversely, privacy is preserved unless the corrupted subset is itself reconstruction-capable.",

We analyze CBDC-specific requirements, considering the applicability of TSSs, and use Filia CBDC solution as a base for a detailed evaluation.

This challenge is magnified in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices face stringent bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Conventional secure aggregation protocols, while essential for protecting model updates, frequently require multiple interaction rounds, large payload sizes, and per-client costs rendering them impractical for many edge deployments. In this work, we present Hyb-Agg, a lightweight and communication-efficient secure aggregation protocol that integrates Multi-Key CKKS (MK-CKKS) homomorphic encryption with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)-based additive masking. Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients. We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size. By directly addressing the communication bottleneck, Hyb-Agg enables scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning that is practical for real-world IoT deployments.",

While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.",

In privacy-concerned federated learning scenarios, conventional deduplication methods typically rely on trusted third parties to perform uniform deletion, risking loss of informative samples while introducing privacy vulnerabilities.

At its core, FedRW proposes a secure, frequency-aware reweighting protocol through secure multi-party computation, coupled with a parallel orchestration strategy to ensure efficiency and scalability. During training, FedRW utilizes an adaptive reweighting mechanism with global sample frequencies to adjust individual loss contributions, effectively improving generalization and robustness. Empirical results demonstrate that FedRW outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving up to 28.78x speedup in preprocessing and approximately 11.42% improvement in perplexity, while offering enhanced security guarantees. FedRW thus establishes a new paradigm for managing duplication in federated LLM training.",

We present DictPFL, a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.

Unlike prior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems, discussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention and blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not without challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory compliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current defense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain integration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and quantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for researchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant financial systems.",

We present OmniFed, a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level override-what-you-need customization. We also support different topologies, mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration, learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration, mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed streamlines FL deployment across heterogeneous environments.

As a mitigation, we develop the first protocol that utilizes neural networks to implement PPFL, as well as incorporating an Aggregatable Hybrid Encryption scheme tailored to the needs of PPFL. We name these networks as Homomorphic Adversarial Networks (HANs) which demonstrate that neural networks are capable of performing tasks similar to multi-key homomorphic encryption (MK-HE) while solving the problems of key distribution and collaborative decryption. Our experiments show that HANs are robust against privacy attacks. Compared with non-private federated learning, experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that HANs exhibit a negligible accuracy loss (at most 1.35%).

      "abstract": "Data normalization is a crucial preprocessing step for enhancing model performance and training stability. In federated learning (FL), where data remains distributed across multiple parties during collaborative model training, normalization presents unique challenges due to the decentralized and often heterogeneous nature of the data. Traditional methods rely on either independent client-side processing, i.e., local normalization, or normalizing the entire dataset before distributing it to parties, i.e., pooled normalization. Local normalization can be problematic when data distributions across parties are non-IID, while the pooled normalization approach conflicts with the decentralized nature of FL. In this paper, we explore the adaptation of widely used normalization techniques to FL and define the term federated normalization. Federated normalization simulates pooled normalization by enabling the collaborative exchange of normalization parameters among parties. Thus, it achieves performance on par with pooled normalization without compromising data locality. However, sharing normalization parameters such as the mean introduces potential privacy risks, which we further mitigate through a robust privacy-preserving solution. Our contributions include: (i) We systematically evaluate the impact of various federated and local normalization techniques in heterogeneous FL scenarios, (ii) We propose a novel homomorphically encrypted $k$-th ranked element (and median) calculation tailored for the federated setting, enabling secure and efficient federated normalization, (iii) We propose privacy-preserving implementations of widely used normalization techniques for FL, leveraging multiparty fully homomorphic encryption (MHE).",

Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) can ensure the protection of omics data privacy against malicious user attacks. However, FL with the DP method faces an inherent trade-off: stronger privacy protection degrades predictive accuracy due to injected noise. On the other hand, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows computations on encrypted data and enables aggregation of encrypted gradients without DP-induced noise can increase the predictive accuracy. However, it may increase the computation cost. To improve the predictive accuracy while considering the computational ability of heterogeneous clients, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)-Hybrid method by introducing HE. In the proposed PPML-Hybrid method, clients distributed select either HE or DP based on their computational resources, so that HE clients contribute noise-free updates while DP clients reduce computational overhead. Meanwhile, clients with high computational resources clients can flexibly adopt HE or DP according to their privacy needs. Performance evaluation on omics datasets show that our proposed method achieves comparable predictive accuracy while significantly reducing computation time relative to HE-only. Additionally, it outperforms DP-only methods under equivalent or stricter privacy budgets.",

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can address those privacy concerns but it suffers from ciphertext expansion and requires prohibitive overhead on resource-constrained devices. We propose the first Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) framework for FL that pairs the PASTA symmetric cipher with the BFV FHE scheme. Clients encrypt local model updates with PASTA and send both the lightweight ciphertexts and the PASTA key (itself BFV-encrypted) to the server, which performs a homomorphic evaluation of the decryption circuit of PASTA and aggregates the resulting BFV ciphertexts. A prototype implementation, developed on top of the Flower FL framework, shows that on independently and identically distributed MNIST dataset with 12 clients and 10 training rounds, the proposed HHE system achieves 97.6% accuracy, just 1.3% below plaintext, while reducing client upload bandwidth by over 2,000x and cutting client runtime by 30% compared to a system based solely on the BFV FHE scheme. However, server computational cost increases by roughly 15621x for each client participating in the training phase, a challenge to be addressed in future work.",

While traditional encryption-based defenses, such as homomorphic encryption, offer strong privacy guarantees without compromising model utility, they often incur prohibitive computational overheads. To mitigate this, selective encryption has emerged as a promising approach, encrypting only a subset of gradient data based on the data's significance under a certain metric. However, there have been few systematic studies on how to specify this metric in practice. This paper systematically evaluates selective encryption methods with different significance metrics against state-of-the-art attacks. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of selective encryption in reducing computational overhead while maintaining resilience against attacks. We propose a distance-based significance analysis framework that provides theoretical foundations for selecting critical gradient elements for encryption. Through extensive experiments on different model architectures (LeNet, CNN, BERT, GPT-2) and attack types, we identify gradient magnitude as a generally effective metric for protection against optimization-based gradient inversions. However, we also observe that no single selective encryption strategy is universally optimal across all attack scenarios, and we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate strategies for different model architectures and privacy requirements.",

      "abstract": "Despite federated learning (FL)'s potential in collaborative learning, its performance has deteriorated due to the data heterogeneity of distributed users. Recently, clustered federated learning (CFL) has emerged to address this challenge by partitioning users into clusters according to their similarity. However, CFL faces difficulties in training when users are unwilling to share their cluster identities due to privacy concerns. To address these issues, we present an innovative Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation scheme for CFL, dubbed EBS-CFL. The proposed EBS-CFL supports effectively training CFL while maintaining users' cluster identity confidentially. Moreover, it detects potential poisonous attacks without compromising individual client gradients by discarding negatively correlated gradients and aggregating positively correlated ones using a weighted approach. The server also authenticates correct gradient encoding by clients. EBS-CFL has high efficiency with client-side overhead O(ml + m^2) for communication and O(m^2l) for computation, where m is the number of cluster identities, and l is the gradient size. When m = 1, EBS-CFL's computational efficiency of client is at least O(log n) times better than comparison schemes, where n is the number of clients.In addition, we validate the scheme through extensive experiments. Finally, we theoretically prove the scheme's security.",

This paper introduces QLink a quantum-safe Layer 3 interoperability protocol that integrates postquantum cryptography (PQC) quantum key distribution (QKD) and hardware security modules (HSMs) into a unified validator architecture. To our knowledge, QLink is the first interoperability framework to combine these mechanisms to secure validator communication proof aggregation and key management. Validators exchange encryption keys through QKD channels, achieving information-theoretic security against interception, while cross-chain proofs are generated and aggregated with NIST-standardized PQC algorithms. Private keys remain sealed inside HSM enclaves mitigating the risk of theft or leakage. Deployed as a dedicated Layer 3 protocol QLink operates independently of Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains providing a scalable decentralized foundation for secure cross-chain messaging and asset transfer. Experimental evaluation using network simulations demonstrates that validator communication overhead remains sub-second while security guarantees extend beyond current bridge architectures to resist both classical and quantum adversaries. By addressing today vulnerabilities and anticipating future quantum threats QLink establishes a practical and future-proof pathway for blockchain interoperability.",

While eSignatures' concrete legal effects depend on the individual case, QESs constitute the highest level of technical protection and authenticity under eIDAS. QESs are based on a qualified certificate issued by a qualified trust service provider (QTSP). Despite legal requirements, technically, a QTSP represents a single point of failure. Contrary, privacy-preserving collaborative computations (P2C2s) have become increasingly practical in recent years; yet lacking an extensive investigation on potential integrations in the QES landscape. We perform a threat analysis on the QES-creation process of Austria's national eID, using STRIDE and a DREAD-like model to extract requirement challenges (RCs) primarily related to: (1) Distributed Service Robustness, (2) Agile Crypto Deployment, and (3) Active User Involvement. To address these RCs, we present QoeSiGN, utilizing novel P2C2 technologies. While currently no P2C2 addresses all RCs, legal aspects, and practical efficiency simultaneously, QoeSiGN gives instantiation possibilities for different needs. For instance, \"Multi-Party HSMs\" for distributed hardware-secured computations; or secure multi-party computation (software) for highest crypto agility and user involvement, where the user participates in the QES computation. Deployment-wise, QTSPs would need to adapt the signing process and setup trusted communication channels. Legal-wise, QoeSiGN's implementation appears permissible, needing further analysis for realization. Technically, QoeSiGN addresses some regulation requirements better than the current solution, such as \"sole control\" or crypto agility. Our identified threats and extracted requirements can be transferred to the general QES ecosystem.",

FedPoP is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing secure aggregation protocols to ensure compatibility with real-world FL deployments. We provide a proof of concept implementation and an empirical evaluation under realistic client dropouts. In our prototype, FedPoP introduces 0.97 seconds of per-round overhead atop securely aggregated FL and enables a client to prove its participation/contribution to a model held by a third party in 0.0612 seconds. These results indicate FedPoP is practical for real-world deployments that require auditable participation without sacrificing privacy.",

The proposed architecture integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen overall security.

Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision (10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1 second per image.

Selective HE methods, which partially encrypt model parameters by a global mask, are expected to protect privacy with reduced overhead and easy adaptation. However, in cross-device scenarios with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, traditional Selective HE methods deteriorate client straggling, and suffer from degraded HE overhead reduction performance. Accordingly, we propose SenseCrypt, a Sensitivity-guided selective Homomorphic EnCryption framework, to adaptively balance security and HE overhead per cross-device FL client. Given the observation that model parameter sensitivity is effective for measuring clients' data distribution similarity, we first design a privacy-preserving method to respectively cluster the clients with similar data distributions. Then, we develop a scoring mechanism to deduce the straggler-free ratio of model parameters that can be encrypted by each client per cluster. Finally, for each client, we formulate and solve a multi-objective model parameter selection optimization problem, which minimizes HE overhead while maximizing model security without causing straggling. Experiments demonstrate that SenseCrypt ensures security against the state-of-the-art inversion attacks, while achieving normal model accuracy as on IID data, and reducing training time by 58.4%-88.7% as compared to traditional HE methods.",

      "abstract": "In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by federated learning (FL), secure aggregation (SA) aims to securely compute, as efficiently as possible, the sum of a set of inputs distributed across many users. To understand the impact of network topology, hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) investigated the communication and secret key generation efficiency in a 3-layer relay network, where clusters of users are connected to the aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Due to the pre-aggregation of the messages at the relays, HSA reduces the communication burden on the relay-to-server links and is able to support a large number of users. However, as the number of users increases, a practical challenge arises from heterogeneous security requirements--for example, users in different clusters may require varying levels of input protection. Motivated by this, we study weakly-secure HSA (WS-HSA) with collusion resilience, where instead of protecting all the inputs from any set of colluding users, only the inputs belonging to a predefined collection of user groups (referred to as security input sets) need to be protected against another predefined collection of user groups (referred to as collusion sets). Since the security input sets and collusion sets can be arbitrarily defined, our formulation offers a flexible framework for addressing heterogeneous security requirements in HSA. We characterize the optimal total key rate, i.e., the total number of independent key symbols required to ensure both server and relay security, for a broad range of parameter configurations. For the remaining cases, we establish lower and upper bounds on the optimal key rate, providing constant-factor gap optimality guarantees.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without exposing clients' data. While clients only share model updates with the aggregator, studies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these updates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during transmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where adversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections, constituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random selection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL performance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which simultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and robust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL implements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The first framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual trust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework handles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them. For the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1) enforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a cluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to prioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a two-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients based on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF) ensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to reduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve energy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\\times$ faster time-to-accuracy and up to $1.06\\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.",

Interestingly, for certain fundamental two-party functions, such as the inner product and Hamming distance, the accuracy of distributed solutions significantly lags behind what can be achieved in the centralized model. For computational differential privacy, however, these limitations can be circumvented using oblivious transfer (used to implement secure multi-party computation). Yet, no results show that oblivious transfer is indeed necessary for accurately estimating a non-Boolean functionality. In particular, for the inner-product functionality, it was previously unknown whether oblivious transfer is necessary even for the best possible constant additive error. In this work, we prove that any computationally differentially private protocol that estimates the inner product over $\\{-1,1\\}^n \\times \\{-1,1\\}^n$ up to an additive error of $O(n^{1/6})$, can be used to construct oblivious transfer. In particular, our result implies that protocols with sub-polynomial accuracy are equivalent to oblivious transfer. In this accuracy regime, our result improves upon Haitner, Mazor, Silbak, and Tsfadia [STOC '22], who showed that a key-agreement protocol is necessary.",

      "abstract": "The mod function plays a critical role in numerous data encoding and cryptographic primitives. However, the widely used CKKS homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme supports only arithmetic operations, making it difficult to perform mod computations on encrypted data. Approximating the mod function with polynomials has therefore become an important yet challenging problem. The discontinuous and periodic characteristics of the mod function make it particularly difficult to approximate accurately under HE. Existing homomorphic mod constructions provide accurate results only within limited subranges of the input range, leaving the problem of achieving accurate approximation across the full input range unresolved. In this work, we propose a novel method based on polynomial interpolation and Chebyshev series to accurately approximate the mod function. Building upon this, we design two efficient data packing schemes, BitStack and CRTStack, tailored for small-integer inputs in CKKS. These schemes significantly improve the utilization of the CKKS plaintext space and enable efficient ciphertext uploads. Furthermore, we apply the proposed HE mod function to implement a homomorphic rounding operation and a general transformation from additive secret sharing to CKKS ciphertexts, achieving accurate ciphertext rounding and complete secret-share-to-CKKS conversion. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high approximation accuracy (up to 1e-8). Overall, our work provides a practical and general solution for performing mod operations under CKKS, extending its applicability to a broader range of privacy-preserving computations.",

Our implementation using various quantum models (VQC, QCNN, and SamplerQNN) reveals minimal performance overhead despite the added security measures. This work establishes a crucial foundation for quantum-resistant autonomous vehicle systems that can operate securely in the post-quantum era while efficiently processing the massive data volumes (20-40TB/day per vehicle) generated by modern autonomous fleets.

Building upon a hierarchical key management architecture with Virtual Key Management Systems (vKMS) and a centralized Quantum Security Controller (QuSeC), the framework dynamically assigns security levels based on node capabilities. By transitioning between pure QKD, hybrid, and PQC modes, it ensures end-to-end quantum-safe protection regardless of the underlying node capabilities. The framework has been implemented and validated on a Kubernetes-based containerized testbed, demonstrating robust operation and performance across all scenarios. Results highlight its potential to support the gradual integration of quantum-safe technologies into existing infrastructures, paving the way toward fully quantum-safe communication networks.",

However, recent studies reveal that sharing model gradients creates vulnerability to Model Inversion Attacks, particularly Deep Leakage from Gradients (DLG), which reconstructs private training data from shared gradients. While Homomorphic Encryption has been proposed as a promising defense mechanism to protect gradient privacy, fully encrypting all model gradients incurs high computational overhead. Selective encryption approaches aim to balance privacy protection with computational efficiency by encrypting only specific gradient components. However, the existing literature largely overlooks a theoretical exploration of the spectral behavior of encrypted versus unencrypted parameters, relying instead primarily on empirical evaluations. To address this gap, this paper presents a framework for theoretical analysis of the underlying principles of selective encryption as a defense against model inversion attacks. We then provide a comprehensive empirical study that identifies and quantifies the critical factors, such as model complexity, encryption ratios, and exposed gradients, that influence defense effectiveness. Our theoretical framework clarifies the relationship between gradient selection and privacy preservation, while our experimental evaluation demonstrates how these factors shape the robustness of defenses against model inversion attacks. Collectively, these contributions advance the understanding of selective encryption mechanisms and offer principled guidance for designing efficient, scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning systems.",

SelectiveShield leverages Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to identify critical parameters locally.

In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel label privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from the perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong correlation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret sharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We devise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead that would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask is the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing for flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual requirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively evaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different modalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods. The results demonstrate that VMask achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, successfully thwarting the MC attack (reducing the label inference accuracy to a random guessing level) while preserving model performance (e.g., in Transformer-based model, the averaged drop of VFL model accuracy is only 0.09%). VMask's runtime is up to 60,846 times faster than cryptography-based methods, and it only marginally exceeds that of standard VFL by 1.8 times in a large Transformer-based model, which is generally acceptable.",

      "abstract": "Federated fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is critical for improving their performance in handling domain-specific tasks. However, prior work has shown that clients' private data can actually be recovered via gradient inversion attacks. Existing privacy preservation techniques against such attacks typically entail performance degradation and high costs, making them ill-suited for clients with heterogeneous data distributions and device capabilities. In this paper, we propose SHE-LoRA, which integrates selective homomorphic encryption (HE) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient and privacy-preserving federated tuning of LLMs in cross-device environment. Heterogeneous clients adaptively select partial model parameters for homomorphic encryption based on parameter sensitivity assessment, with the encryption subset obtained via negotiation. To ensure accurate model aggregation, we design a column-aware secure aggregation method and customized reparameterization techniques to align the aggregation results with the heterogeneous device capabilities of clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHE-LoRA maintains performance comparable to non-private baselines, achieves strong resistance to the state-of-the-art attacks, and significantly reduces communication overhead by 94.901\\% and encryption computation overhead by 99.829\\%, compared to baseline.

However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links. Critical research directions include reducing dependence on trusted nodes through quantum repeaters or post-quantum cryptography, developing standardized key management interfaces for interoperability, and adopting AI-driven predictive routing for adapting to fluctuating network states. This comprehensive synthesis of routing algorithms, performance trade-offs, and unresolved issues offers practical guidance for engineering secure, adaptable, and large-scale QKD networks capable of meeting real-world deployment demands.",

Armadillo is designed for federated learning setting, where a single powerful server interacts with many weak clients iteratively to train models on client's private data. While a few prior works consider disruption resistance under such setting, they either incur high per-client cost (Chowdhury et al. CCS '22) or require many rounds (Bell et al. USENIX Security '23). Although disruption resistance can be achieved generically with zero-knowledge proof techniques (which we also use in this paper), we realize an efficient system with two new designs: 1) a simple two-layer secure aggregation protocol that requires only simple arithmetic computation; 2) an agreement protocol that removes the effect of malicious clients from the aggregation with low round complexity. With these techniques, Armadillo completes each secure aggregation in 3 rounds while keeping the server and clients computationally lightweight.",

      "abstract": "Secure aggregation is a common technique in federated learning (FL) for protecting data privacy from both curious internal entities (clients or server) and external adversaries (eavesdroppers). However, in dynamic and resource-constrained environments such as low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks, traditional secure aggregation methods fall short in two aspects: (1) they assume continuous client availability while LEO satellite visibility is intermittent and irregular; (2) they consider privacy in each communication round but have overlooked the possible privacy leakage through multiple rounds. To address these limitations, we propose LTP-FLEO, an asynchronous FL framework that preserves long-term privacy (LTP) for LEO satellite networks. LTP-FLEO introduces (i) privacy-aware satellite partitioning, which groups satellites based on their predictable visibility to the server and enforces joint participation; (ii) model age balancing, which mitigates the adverse impact of stale model updates; and (iii) fair global aggregation, which treats satellites of different visibility durations in an equitable manner. Theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that LTP-FLEO effectively safeguards both model and data privacy across multi-round training, promotes fairness in line with satellite contributions, accelerates global convergence, and achieves competitive model accuracy.",

A key component is secure aggregation, which keeps individual updates hidden from both the server and users, while also defending against Byzantine users who corrupt the aggregation. To this end, Jinhyun So et al. recently developed a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation scheme using a secret-sharing strategy over finite-field arithmetic. However, such an approach can suffer from numerical errors and overflows when applied to real-valued model updates, motivating the need for secure aggregation methods that operate directly over the real domain. We propose FORTA, a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation framework that operates entirely in the real domain. FORTA leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codes for privacy and employs Krum-based outlier detection for robustness. While DFT decoder is error-free under infinite precision, finite precision introduces numerical perturbations that can distort distance estimates and allow malicious updates to evade detection. To address this, FORTA refines Krum using feedback from DFT decoder, improving the selection of trustworthy updates. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that our modification of Krum offers improved robustness and more accurate aggregation than standard Krum.",

Therefore, third-party inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.",

In this paper, we design a flexible threshold multi-client functional encryption for inner product (FTMCFE-IP) scheme, where multiple clients generate ciphertexts independently without any interaction. In the encryption phase, clients are able to choose a threshold flexibly without reinitializing the system. The decryption can be performed correctly when the number of online clients satisfies the threshold. An authorized user are allowed to compute the inner product of the vectors associated with his/her functional key and the ciphertext, respectively, but cannot learning anything else. Especially, the presented scheme supports clients drop out. Furthermore, we provide the definition and security model of our FTMCFE-IP scheme,and propose a concrete construction. The security of the designed scheme is formally proven. Finally, we implement and evaluate our FTMCFE-IP scheme.",

An advantage of Switched QKD is that it distributes quantum keys end-to-end, whereas Relayed relies on trusted nodes. However, Switched depends on arbitrary matching of QKD modules. We first experimentally evaluate the performance of commercial DV-QKD modules; for each of three vendors we benchmark the performance in standard/matched module pairs and in unmatched pairs to emulate configurations in the Switched QKD network architecture. The analysis reveals that in some cases a notable variation in the generated secret key rate (SKR) between the matched and unmatched pairs is observed. Driven by these experimental findings, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis that evaluates the network-wide performance of the two architectures. Our analysis is based on uniform ring networks, where we derive optimal key management configurations and analytical formulas for the achievable consumed SKR. We compare network performance under varying ring sizes, QKD link losses, QKD receivers' sensitivity and performance penalties of unmatched modules. Our findings indicate that Switched QKD performs better in dense rings (short distances, large node counts), while Relayed QKD is more effective in longer distances and large node counts. Moreover, we confirm that unmatched QKD modules penalties significantly impact the efficiency of Switched QKD architecture.",

We evaluated the landscape of quantum threats across the entire CC stack, demonstrating how quantum algorithms can undermine classical encryption and compromise cloud security at multiple architectural layers. Using a structured risk assessment methodology based on the STRIDE model, we evaluate quantum-induced attack vectors and their impact on cloud environments.

The architecture includes novel components: a decentralized authentication layer (dAuth), an in-memory state database (CSTORE), a distributed storage system (R1FS), homomorphic encrypted federated learning (EDIL), decentralized container orchestration (Deeploy) and an oracle network (OracleSync), which collectively ensure secure, resilient execution of AI pipelines and other container based apps at scale.

We provide mathematical formulations of its secure licensing and reward protocols, and include descriptive information for the system architecture and protocol flow. We argue that our proposed fully functional ecosystem proposes and demonstrates significant improvements in accessibility, scalability, and security over existing alternatives.",

      "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, but individual model updates may still leak sensitive information. Secure aggregation (SecAgg) mitigates this risk by allowing the server to access only the sum of client updates, thereby concealing individual contributions. However, a significant vulnerability has recently attracted increasing attention: when model updates are sparse vectors, a non-zero value contributed by a single client at a given index can be directly revealed in the aggregate, enabling precise data reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel enhancement to SecAgg that reveals aggregated values only at indices with at least $t$ non-zero contributions. Our mechanism introduces a per-element masking strategy to prevent the exposure of under-contributed elements, while maintaining modularity and compatibility with many existing SecAgg implementations by relying solely on cryptographic primitives already employed in a typical setup. We integrate this mechanism into Flamingo, a low-round SecAgg protocol, to provide a robust defense against such attacks. Our analysis and experimental results indicate that the additional computational and communication overhead introduced by our mechanism remains within an acceptable range, supporting the practicality of our approach.",

Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) mitigates these issues on the edge side by replacing HE with lightweight symmetric encryption for plaintext encryption, such as the Rubato cipher for the HHE variant of RNS-CKKS, yet it introduces transciphering overhead on the cloud. The respective strengths and limitations of FHE and HHE call for a dual-mode HHE solution with flexible algorithm switching ability. This paper presents DNA-HHE, the first dual-mode HHE accelerator with near-network coupling for edge devices. DNA-HHE supports both edge-side RNS-CKKS and Rubato within a unified architecture driven by flexible custom instructions. To realize a compact implementation for the edge side, we propose a DSP-efficient modular reduction design, a compact multi-field-adaptive butterfly unit, and parallel scheduling schemes of Rubato with a high degree of resource sharing. DNA-HHE is designed with network protocol packaging and transmission capacities and directly coupled to the network interface controller, achieving reduced overall latency of edge-side PPOC by 1.09$\\times$ to 1.56$\\times$. Our evaluations on the ASIC and FPGA platforms demonstrate that DNA-HHE outperforms the state-of-the-art single-mode designs in both edge-side RNS-CKKS and symmetric cipher with better computation latency and area efficiency, while offering dual-mode functionality.",

We further discover that the overall CKKS pipeline throughput is constrained by low per-kernel hardware utilization, caused by insufficient intra-kernel parallelism.

Accelerating homomorphic encrypted MM (HE MM) is therefore crucial for applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper, we present a bandwidth-efficient FPGA implementation of HE MM. We first develop a cost model to evaluate the on-chip memory requirements for a given set of HE parameters and input matrix sizes. Our analysis shows that optimizing on-chip memory usage is critical for scalable and efficient HE MM. To this end, we design a novel datapath for Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT), the primary bottleneck in HE MM. The proposed datapath significantly reduces off-chip memory traffic and on-chip memory demand by enabling fine-grained data reuse. Leveraging this datapath, we introduce FAME, the first FPGA-based accelerator specifically tailored for HE MM. FAME supports arbitrary matrix shapes and is configurable across a wide range of HE parameter sets. We implement FAME on an Alveo U280 FPGA and evaluate its performance across diverse matrix sizes and shapes.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a solution to this data privacy issue by enabling computations directly upon encrypted queries. However, running encrypted transformer inference is challenging as programmers must map standard kernels to the constrained instruction set provided by FHE. In this work, we explore implementations of linear algebra kernels needed for transformer inference in FHE and understand how network optimization can help mitigate FHE costs while remaining performant. We leverage the Orion PyTorch to FHE framework to benchmark several linear algebra kernels in order to profile two linear transformation methods, packed row and BSGS, and find that BSGS outperforms packed row methods by up to $13.7 \\times$ at transformer-level scales. We also incorporate network-level pruning strategies that reduce FHE runtimes of feed forward layers by up to $11.46\\times$. Furthermore, we extend Orion to include ciphertext-ciphertext matrix-matrix products, a key component in the self-attention blocks. Finally, we perform a roofline analysis of FHE primitives and encrypted linear transformations and find that (SIMD encoded) implementations are memory-bound with primitives having roughly $0.1$ integer operations per byte of DRAM traffic. These findings illustrate the need for exploring alternative encoding schemes and models of computation within CKKS to unlock scalable private transformer inference.

The scope of this study focuses on enabling the management of insurance claims in a transparent, privacy-protecting manner while maintaining the efficiency and trust level needed by the patients, healthcare providers, and insurers. To accomplish this, the proposed system adds blockchain technology to provide an unchangeable, decentralized, and auditable claim transactions ledger which enhances overall claim-related processes and trust among all stakeholders. To protect critical patient information, the framework employs homomorphic encryption a modern form of cryptography to allow authorized insurance providers to perform necessary operations like claim adjudication and reimbursement on encrypted medical records without any decryption during the process. This method significantly reduces the third-party processing privacy risk because patient data can be kept secret even when third-party processing is done. In addition, smart contracts improve automation of the most important procedures in the claim processing pipeline, which decreases manual, operational, and susceptibility towards human blunders or deceitful acts. The integration of these two transformative technologiesblockchain and homomorphic encryption represents the core contribution of this work, enabling the coexistence of transparency and privacy which are usually viewed as competing objectives in traditional systems. As a result, these technologies are expected to foster the creation of a reliable, effective, and privacy safeguarding architecture that could transform the medical claim submission systems paradigm.",

However, the emergence of quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's threatens to render these techniques vulnerable, necessitating the development of quantum-resilient alternatives. This chapter examines the implications of quantum computing for IoT security and explores strategies for building cryptographically robust systems in the post-quantum era. It presents an overview of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) families, including lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, and multivariate approaches, analyzing their potential for deployment in resource-constrained IoT environments. In addition, quantum-based methods such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) are discussed for their ability to enhance confidentiality and privacy through physics-based security guarantees. The chapter also highlights issues of privacy management, regulatory compliance, and standardization, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across academia, industry, and governance. Overall, it provides a comprehensive perspective on security IoT ecosystems against quantum threats and ensures resilience in the next generation of intelligent networks.",

      "abstract": "Virtual power plants (VPPs) are becoming a cornerstone of future grids, aggregating distributed PV, wind, storage, and flexible loads for market participation and real-time balancing. As operations move to minute-- and second--level feedback, communication security shifts from a compliance item to an operational constraint: latency, reliability, and confidentiality jointly determine whether dispatch, protection, and settlement signals arrive on time. Conventional PKI and key-rotation schemes struggle with cross-domain, high-frequency messaging and face long-term quantum threats. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic key freshness, but its key yield is scarce and stochastic, often misaligned with bursty VPP traffic. This paper proposes a key-aware priority and quota framework that treats quantum keys as first-class scheduling resources. The design combines (i) forecast-driven long-term quotas and short-term tokens, (ii) key-aware deficit-round-robin arbitration, (iii) a preemptive emergency key reserve, and (iv) graceful degradation via encryption-mode switching and controlled down-sampling for non-critical traffic. A drift-plus-penalty analysis establishes strong stability under average supply--demand balance with quantifiable bounds on backlog and tail latency, providing interpretable operating guarantees. We build a reproducible testbed on IEEE 33- and 123-bus VPP systems and evaluate normal, degraded, and outage regimes with industry-consistent message classes and TTLs. Against FIFO, fixed-priority, and static-quota baselines, the proposed scheme consistently reduces tail delay and passive timeouts for critical messages, improves per-bit key utility, and enhances power-tracking reliability during key scarcity and regime switches.",

Consequently, recent studies have proposed hybrid schemes that combine QKD and PQC to establish a dual-layered security model. In response to this trend, this study proposes hybrid schemes that integrate QKD with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized PQC algorithms. These hybrid schemes include two core components: a hybrid QKD-PQC key exchange protocol and a hybrid QKD-PQC digital signature scheme. For the hybrid key exchange protocol, this study combines Module-Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (ML-KEM) with QKD protocols, specifically BB84 and E91, to construct a secure key exchange protocol. In the design of the hybrid digital signature scheme, this study utilizes Module-Lattice-based Digital Signature Algorithms (ML-DSA) and Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature Algorithms (SLH-DSA) to generate signature reconstruction values. These values are verified using confirmation codes transmitted via the BB84 and E91 protocols. The proposed hybrid key exchange protocol is evaluated by examining the shared secret key it produces, particularly with respect to entropy and whether the output is independent and identically distributed (IID). Furthermore, the computation time and message lengths of the proposed hybrid schemes are evaluated.",

Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative risk assessment without centralizing user data. However, existing FL approaches struggle with Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) user features, resulting in biased, unstable, and poorly generalized global models. This paper introduces FL-RBA2, a novel Federated Learning framework for Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication that addresses Non-IID challenges through a mathematically grounded similarity transformation. By converting heterogeneous user features (including behavioral, biometric, contextual, interaction-based, and knowledge-based modalities) into IID similarity vectors, FL-RBA2 supports unbiased aggregation and personalized risk modeling across distributed clients. The framework mitigates cold-start limitations via clustering-based risk labeling, incorporates Differential Privacy (DP) to safeguard sensitive information, and employs Message Authentication Codes (MACs) to ensure model integrity and authenticity. Federated updates are securely aggregated into a global model, achieving strong balance between user privacy, scalability, and adaptive authentication robustness. Rigorous game-based security proofs in the Random Oracle Model formally establish privacy, correctness, and adaptive security guarantees. Extensive experiments on keystroke, mouse, and contextual datasets validate FL-RBA2's effectiveness in high-risk user detection and its resilience to model inversion and inference attacks, even under strong DP constraints.",

Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: (1) the reliance on heavyweight encryption techniques results in substantial communication and computation overhead; and (2) single-strategy defense mechanisms often fail to provide sufficient robustness against adaptive adversaries. To overcome these challenges, we propose DP2Guard, a lightweight PPFL framework that enhances both privacy and robustness. DP2Guard leverages a lightweight gradient masking mechanism to replace costly cryptographic operations while ensuring the privacy of local gradients. A hybrid defense strategy is proposed, which extracts gradient features using singular value decomposition and cosine similarity, and applies a clustering algorithm to effectively identify malicious gradients. Additionally, DP2Guard adopts a trust score-based adaptive aggregation scheme that adjusts client weights according to historical behavior, while blockchain records aggregated results and trust scores to ensure tamper-proof and auditable training. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that DP2Guard effectively defends against four advanced poisoning attacks while ensuring privacy with reduced communication and computation costs.",

However, the distributed and edge-based nature of 5G-MEC presents privacy and security challenges, including data exposure risks. Ensuring efficient manipulation and security of sensitive data at the edge is crucial. To address these challenges, we investigate the usage of threshold secret sharing in 5G-MEC storage, an approach that enhances both security and dependability. A (k,n) threshold secret sharing scheme splits and stores sensitive data among n nodes, requiring at least k nodes for reconstruction. The solution ensures confidentiality by protecting data against fewer than k colluding nodes and enhances availability by tolerating up to n-k failing nodes. This approach mitigates threats such as unauthorized access and node failures, whether accidental or intentional. We further discuss a method for selecting the convenient MEHs to store the shares, considering the MEHs' trustworthiness level as a main criterion. Although we define our proposal in the context of secret-shared data storage, it can be seen as an independent, standalone selection process for 5G-MEC trustworthy node selection in other scenarios too.",

      "abstract": "As cloud environments become widespread, cybersecurity has emerged as a top priority across areas such as networks, communication, data privacy, response times, and availability. Various sectors, including industries, healthcare, and government, have recently faced cyberattacks targeting their computing systems. Ensuring secure app deployment in cloud environments requires substantial effort. With the growing interest in cloud security, conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is critical to identifying research gaps. Continuous Software Engineering, which includes continuous integration (CI), delivery (CDE), and deployment (CD), is essential for software development and deployment. In our SLR, we reviewed 66 papers, summarising tools, approaches, and challenges related to the security of CI/CD in the cloud. We addressed key aspects of cloud security and CI/CD and reported on tools such as Harbor, SonarQube, and GitHub Actions. Challenges such as image manipulation, unauthorised access, and weak authentication were highlighted. The review also uncovered research gaps in how tools and practices address these security issues in CI/CD pipelines, revealing a need for further study to improve cloud-based security solutions.",

However, the absence of data type-specific encryption and decryption procedures renders multimedia data vulnerable. To address this issue, this study presents a dynamic encryption-based security architecture that adapts encryption methods to any file type, using keys generated from facial images and passwords. Four diverse datasets are created, each with a consistent size of 2GB, containing varying combinations of image, audio (MP3 and MPEG), video, text, CSV, PPT, and PDF files, to implement the proposed methodology. AES is used to encrypt image data, AES-CTR is employed for audio or video data to meet real-time streaming needs, and Blowfish is used for other types of data. Performance analysis on all four datasets is conducted using AWS servers, where DATASET-1 demonstrates the best performance compared to the others.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while safeguarding data and user privacy. However, FL remains susceptible to privacy threats that can compromise data via direct means. That said, indirectly compromising the confidentiality of the FL model architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN)) on a client device by an outsider remains unexplored. If leaked, this information can enable next-level attacks tailored to the architecture. This paper proposes a novel side-channel fingerprinting attack, leveraging flow-level and packet-level statistics of encrypted wireless traffic from an FL client to infer its deep learning model architecture. We name it FLARE, a fingerprinting framework based on FL Architecture REconnaissance. Evaluation across various CNN and RNN variants-including pre-trained and custom models trained over IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi-shows that FLARE achieves over 98% F1-score in closed-world and up to 91% in open-world scenarios. These results reveal that CNN and RNN models leak distinguishable traffic patterns, enabling architecture fingerprinting even under realistic FL settings with hardware, software, and data heterogeneity. To our knowledge, this is the first work to fingerprint FL model architectures by sniffing encrypted wireless traffic, exposing a critical side-channel vulnerability in current FL systems.",

However, transmitting raw sensor data to a centralized server for machine learning (ML) model training raises serious privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative by enabling decentralized model training without exposing sensitive local data. Yet, applying FL in underground mining presents unique challenges: (i) Adversaries may eavesdrop on shared model updates to launch model inversion or membership inference attacks, compromising data privacy and operational safety; (ii) Non-IID data distributions across mines and sensor noise can hinder model convergence. To address these issues, we propose FedMining--a privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for underground mining. FedMining introduces two core innovations: (1) a Decentralized Functional Encryption (DFE) scheme that keeps local models encrypted, thwarting unauthorized access and inference attacks; and (2) a balancing aggregation mechanism to mitigate data heterogeneity and enhance convergence. Evaluations on real-world mining datasets demonstrate FedMining's ability to safeguard privacy while maintaining high model accuracy and achieving rapid convergence with reduced communication and computation overhead. These advantages make FedMining both secure and practical for real-time underground safety monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Device identifiers like the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) are crucial for ensuring device integrity and meeting regulations in 4G and 5G networks. However, sharing these identifiers with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) brings significant privacy risks by enabling long-term tracking and linking of user activities across sessions. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving identifier checking method in 5G. This paper introduces a protocol for verifying device identifiers without exposing them to the network while maintaining the same functions as the 3GPP-defined Equipment Identity Register (EIR) process. The proposed solution modifies the PEPSI protocol for a Private Set Membership (PSM) setting using the BFV homomorphic encryption scheme. This lets User Equipment (UE) prove that its identifier is not on an operator's blacklist or greylist while ensuring that the MNO only learns the outcome of the verification. The protocol allows controlled deanonymization through an authorized Law Enforcement (LE) hook, striking a balance between privacy and accountability. Implementation results show that the system can perform online verification within five seconds and requires about 15 to 16 MB of communication per session. This confirms its practical use under post-quantum security standards. The findings highlight the promise of homomorphic encryption for managing identifiers while preserving privacy in 5G, laying the groundwork for scalable and compliant verification systems in future 6G networks.",

      "abstract": "As AI agents increasingly operate in real-world, multi-agent environments, ensuring reliable and context-aware privacy in agent communication is critical, especially to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. Traditional access controls are insufficient, as privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may use information in ways that compromise privacy, such as messaging humans, sharing context with other agents, making tool calls, persisting data, or generating derived private information. Existing approaches often treat privacy as a binary constraint, whether data is shareable or not, overlooking nuanced, role-specific, and computation-dependent privacy needs essential for regulatory compliance. Agents, including those based on large language models, are inherently probabilistic and heuristic. There is no formal guarantee of how an agent will behave for any query, making them ill-suited for operations critical to security. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a four-tiered framework for fine-grained, encrypted agent communication that adds a protection layer atop any AI agent platform. AgentCrypt spans unrestricted data exchange (Level 1) to fully encrypted computation using techniques such as homomorphic encryption (Level 4). Crucially, it guarantees the privacy of tagged data is always maintained, prioritizing privacy above correctness. AgentCrypt ensures privacy across diverse interactions and enables computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers such as data silos. We implemented and tested it with Langgraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across platforms. We also introduce a benchmark dataset simulating privacy-critical tasks at all privacy levels, enabling systematic evaluation and fostering the development of regulatable machine learning systems for secure agent communication and computation.",

      "abstract": "The deep learning (DL) has been penetrating daily life in many domains, how to keep the DL model inference secure and sample privacy in an encrypted environment has become an urgent and increasingly important issue for various security-critical applications. To date, several approaches have been proposed based on the Residue Number System variant of the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme. However, they all suffer from high latency, which severely limits the applications in real-world tasks. Currently, the research on encrypted inference in deep CNNs confronts three main bottlenecks: i) the time and storage costs of convolution calculation; ii) the time overhead of huge bootstrapping operations; and iii) the consumption of circuit multiplication depth. Towards these three challenges, we in this paper propose an efficient and effective mechanism FastFHE to accelerate the model inference while simultaneously retaining high inference accuracy over fully homomorphic encryption. Concretely, our work elaborates four unique novelties. First, we propose a new scalable ciphertext data-packing scheme to save the time and storage consumptions. Second, we work out a depthwise-separable convolution fashion to degrade the computation load of convolution calculation. Third, we figure out a BN dot-product fusion matrix to merge the ciphertext convolutional layer with the batch-normalization layer without incurring extra multiplicative depth. Last but not least, we adopt the low-degree Legendre polynomial to approximate the nonlinear smooth activation function SiLU under the guarantee of tiny accuracy error before and after encrypted inference. Finally, we execute multi-facet experiments to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

To realize this, DEXO extends the decentralized oracle network model that has been successful in the blockchain applications domain to incorporate novel hardware-cryptographic co-design that harmonizes trusted execution environment, secret sharing, and smart contract-assisted fair exchange. For the first time, DEXO ensures end-to-end data confidentiality, source verifiability, and fairness of the exchange process with strong resilience against participant collusion.

Since modular multiplication dominates the processing time in these applications, computational complexity and memory limitations significantly impact performance. Computing-in-Memory (CiM) is a promising approach to tackle this problem. However, existing schemes currently suffer from two main problems: 1) Most works focus on low bit-width modular multiplication, which is inadequate for mainstream cryptographic algorithms such as elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the RSA algorithm, both of which require high bit-width operations; 2) Recent efforts targeting large number modular multiplication rely on inefficient in-memory logic operations, resulting in high scaling costs for larger bit-widths and increased latency. To address these issues, we propose LaMoS, an efficient SRAM-based CiM design for large-number modular multiplication, offering high scalability and area efficiency. First, we analyze the Barrett's modular multiplication method and map the workload onto SRAM CiM macros for high bit-width cases. Additionally, we develop an efficient CiM architecture and dataflow to optimize large-number modular multiplication. Finally, we refine the mapping scheme for better scalability in high bit-width scenarios using workload grouping. Experimental results show that LaMoS achieves a $7.02\\times$ speedup and reduces high bit-width scaling costs compared to existing SRAM-based CiM designs.",

      "abstract": "The 5G protocol lacks a robust base station (BS) authentication mechanism during the initial bootstrapping phase, leaving it susceptible to threats such as fake BSs, spoofed broadcasts, and large-scale manipulation of System Information Blocks (SIBs). Despite real-world 5G deployments increasingly relying on multi-BS communication and user multi-connectivity, existing solutions incur high communication overheads, rely on centralized trust, and lack accountability and long-term breach resiliency. Given the inevitability of BS compromise and the severe impact of forged SIBs as the root of trust (e.g., fake alerts, tracking, false roaming), distributed trust, verifiable forgery detection, and audit logging are essential, yet remain largely unexplored in 5G authentication. These challenges are further amplified by the emergence of quantum-capable adversaries. While integration of NIST PQC standards is widely viewed as a path toward long-term security and future-proofing 5G authentication, their feasibility under strict packet size, latency, and broadcast constraints has not been systematically studied. This work presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive network-level performance characterization of integrating NIST-PQC standards and conventional digital signatures into 5G BS authentication, showing that direct PQC adoption is impractical due to protocol constraints, delays, and large signature sizes. To address these challenges, we propose BORG, a future-proof authentication framework based on a hierarchical identity-based threshold signature with fail-stop properties. BORG distributes trust across multiple BSs, enables post-mortem forgery detection, and provides tamper-evident, post-quantum secure audit logging, while maintaining compact signatures, avoiding fragmentation, and incurring minimal UE overhead, as shown in our 5G testbed implementation.",

      "abstract": "Image security for information has become increasingly critical as internet become more prevalent due to hacking and unauthorized access. To ensure the security of confidential image data, image encryption using visual cryptography plays a crucial role. To share multiple images using visual cryptography, the company organizer utilizes the concept of a universal or common share. Likewise, quantum computing is an emerging technology that facilitates secure communication. The ability of quantum computers to solve certain mathematical problems efficiently threatens the security of many current encryption algorithms. Hence, to leverage the strengths of quantum computing and visual cryptography, this research introduces a novel universal share-based quantum multi-secret sharing technique for secure image communication. Quantum computing enables the scheme to exhibit high resilience to different eavesdropping threats. Consequently, the proposed method offers robust security solution for sharing confidential images across a range of applications, including enterprise data access and military communications.",

      ],
      "abstract": "Privacy-preserving inference of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using homomorphic encryption has emerged as a promising approach for enabling secure machine learning in untrusted environments. In our previous work, we introduced a matrix-encoding strategy that allows convolution and matrix multiplication to be efficiently evaluated over encrypted data, enabling practical CNN inference without revealing either the input data or the model parameters. The core idea behind this strategy is to construct a three-dimensional representation within ciphertexts that preserves the intrinsic spatial structure of both input image data and model weights, rather than flattening them into conventional two-dimensional encodings. However, this approach can operate efficiently $only$ when the number of available plaintext slots within a ciphertext is sufficient to accommodate an entire input image, which becomes a critical bottleneck when processing high-resolution images. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by proposing an improved encoding and computation framework that removes the requirement that a single encrypted ciphertext must fully contain one input image. Our method reformulates the data layout and homomorphic operations to partition high-resolution inputs across multiple ciphertexts while preserving the algebraic structure required for efficient convolution and matrix multiplication. As a result, our approach enables privacy-preserving CNN inference to scale naturally beyond the slot-capacity constraints of prior methods, making homomorphic evaluation of CNNs practical for higher-resolution and more complex datasets.",

      "abstract": "While end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, it does not secure metadata, which exposes sender and receiver information through traffic analysis. A plausible approach to protecting this metadata is to have senders post encrypted messages on a public bulletin board and receivers scan it for relevant messages. Oblivious message retrieval (OMR) leverages homomorphic encryption (HE) to improve user experience in this solution by delegating the scan to a resource-rich server while preserving privacy. A key process in OMR is the homomorphic detection of pertinent messages for the receiver from the bulletin board. It relies on a specialized matrix-vector multiplication algorithm, which involves extensive multiplications between ciphertext vectors and plaintext matrices, as well as homomorphic rotations. The computationally intensive nature of this process limits the practicality of OMR. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hardware architecture to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication algorithm. The building homomorphic operators in this algorithm are implemented using high-level synthesis, with design parameters for different parallelism levels. These operators are then deployed on a field-programmable gate array platform using an efficient design space exploration strategy to accelerate homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication. Compared to a software implementation, the proposed hardware accelerator achieves a 13.86x speedup.",

      "abstract": "Encrypted AI using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) provides strong privacy guarantees; but its slow performance has limited practical deployment. Recent works proposed ASICs to accelerate FHE, but require expensive advanced manufacturing processes that constrain their accessibility. GPUs are a far more accessible platform, but achieving ASIC-level performance using GPUs has remained elusive. Furthermore, state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on small models that fit comfortably within a single device. Supporting large models such as LLMs in FHE introduces a dramatic increase in computational complexity that requires optimized GPU kernels, along with managing terabyte-scale memory footprints that far exceed the capacity of a single GPU. This paper presents Cerium, a multi-GPU framework for FHE inference on large models. Cerium integrates a domain-specific language, an optimizing compiler, and a runtime system to automatically generate high-performance GPU kernels, manage terabyte-scale memory footprints, and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. It introduces new IR constructs, compiler passes, sparse polynomial representations, memory-efficient data layouts, and communication-aware parallelization techniques that together enable encrypted inference for models ranging from small CNNs to Llama3-8B. We build Cerium on NVIDIA GPUs and demonstrate significant performance gains. For small models, Cerium outperforms expert-written hand-optimized GPU libraries by up to 2.25 times. Cerium achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art FHE ASICs, outright matching prior FHE ASIC CraterLake. It is the first GPU system to execute bootstrapping in under 10 milliseconds, achieving 7.5 milliseconds, and is the first to demonstrate encrypted inference for BERT-Base and Llama3-8B in 8 seconds and 134 seconds, respectively.",

This system enables DNA synthesizers to screen order requests against a database of hazards. By applying novel cryptography, the system aims to keep order requests and the database of hazards secret. Discerning the detailed operation of the system in part from source code (Version 1.0.8), our analysis examines key management, certificate infrastructure, authentication, and rate-limiting mechanisms. We also perform the first formal-methods analysis of the mutual authentication, basic request, and exemption-handling protocols. Without breaking the cryptography, our main finding is that SecureDNA's custom mutual authentication protocol SCEP achieves only one-way authentication: the hazards database and keyservers never learn with whom they communicate. This structural weakness violates the principle of defense in depth and enables an adversary to circumvent rate limits that protect the secrecy of the hazards database, if the synthesizer connects with a malicious or corrupted keyserver or hashed database. We point out an additional structural weakness that also violates the principle of defense in depth: inadequate cryptographic bindings prevent the system from detecting if responses, within a TLS channel, from the hazards database were modified. Consequently, if a synthesizer were to reconnect with the database over the same TLS session, an adversary could replay and swap responses from the database without breaking TLS. Although the SecureDNA implementation does not allow such reconnections, it would be stronger security engineering to avoid the underlying structural weakness. We identify these vulnerabilities and suggest and verify mitigations, including adding strong bindings. Software Version 1.1.0 fixes SCEP with our proposed SCEP+ protocol.",

We resolve this challenge by introducing the Trustworthy Influence Protocol (TIP), a privacy-preserving framework that enables prospective buyers to quantify the utility of external data without ever decrypting the raw assets. By integrating Homomorphic Encryption with gradient-based influence functions, our approach allows for the precise, blinded scoring of data points against a buyer's specific AI model. To ensure scalability for Large Language Models (LLMs), we employ low-rank gradient projections that reduce computational overhead while maintaining near-perfect fidelity to plaintext baselines, as demonstrated across BERT and GPT-2 architectures. Empirical simulations in healthcare and generative AI domains validate the framework's economic potential: we show that encrypted valuation signals achieve a high correlation with realized clinical utility and reveal a heavy-tailed distribution of data value in pre-training corpora where a minority of texts drive capability while the majority degrades it. These findings challenge prevailing flat-rate compensation models and offer a scalable technical foundation for a meritocratic, secure data economy.",

Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment. In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. Our results highlight CryptoTensors as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly solution for safeguarding LLM weights in real-world and widespread deployments.",

These gaps limit the applicability of hybrid systems in practical, deployed networks. In this work, we advance a recently proposed hybrid QKD-PQC system by integrating tight finite-key security to the QKD primitive and improving the design for better scalability. This hybrid system employs an information-theoretically secure instruction sequence that determines the configurations of different primitives and thus ensures message confidentiality even when both the QKD and the PQC primitives are compromised. The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions.",

Fast polynomial modular multiplication and fast pointwise multiplication problems are important for cryptosystem applications such as post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption. By establishing the equivalence of these problems, we show that a fast structure from one domain can be used to design a fast structure for another domain. This understanding is important as there are many well known solutions for fast convolution that can be used in other signal processing and cryptosystem applications.",

      "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) is an essential cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving applications, enabling a client to retrieve a record from a server's database without revealing which record was requested. Single-server PIR based on homomorphic encryption has particularly gained immense attention for its ease of deployment and reduced trust assumptions. However, single-server PIR remains impractical due to its high computational and memory bandwidth demands. Specifically, reading the entirety of large databases from storage, such as SSDs, severely limits its performance. To address this, we propose IVE, an accelerator for single-server PIR with a systematic extension that enables practical retrieval from large databases using DRAM. Recent advances in DRAM capacity allow PIR for large databases to be served entirely from DRAM, removing its dependence on storage bandwidth. Although the memory bandwidth bottleneck still remains, multi-client batching effectively amortizes database access costs across concurrent requests to improve throughput. However, client-specific data remains a bottleneck, whose bandwidth requirements ultimately limits performance. IVE overcomes this by employing a large on-chip scratchpad with an operation scheduling algorithm that maximizes data reuse, further boosting throughput. Additionally, we introduce sysNTTU, a versatile functional unit that enhances area efficiency without sacrificing performance. We also propose a heterogeneous memory system architecture, which enables a linear scaling of database sizes without a throughput degradation. Consequently, IVE achieves up to 1,275x higher throughput compared to prior PIR hardware solutions.",

      "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is revolutionizing cryptography by promising information-theoretic security through the immutable laws of quantum mechanics. Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations.",

      "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), particularly the CKKS scheme, is a promising enabler for privacy-preserving MLaaS, but its practical deployment faces a prohibitive barrier: it heavily relies on domain expertise. Configuring CKKS involves a tightly coupled space of ring dimensions, modulus chains, and packing layouts. Without deep cryptographic knowledge to navigate these interactions, practitioners are restricted to compilers that rely on fixed heuristics. These \"one-shot\" tools often emit rigid configurations that are either severely over-provisioned in latency or fail to find a feasible solution entirely for deeper networks. We present FHE-Agent, an agentic framework that automates this expert reasoning process. By coupling a Large Language Model (LLM) controller with a deterministic tool suite, FHE-Agent decomposes the search into global parameter selection and layer-wise bottleneck repair. The agents operate within a multi-fidelity workflow, pruning invalid regimes using cheap static analysis and reserving expensive encrypted evaluations for the most promising candidates. We instantiate FHE-Agent on the Orion compiler and evaluate it on standard benchmarks (MLP, LeNet, LoLa) and deeper architectures (AlexNet). FHE-Agent consistently achieves better precision and lower latency than na\u00efve search strategies. Crucially, it automatically discovers feasible, 128-bit secure configurations for complex models where baseline heuristics and one-shot prompts fail to produce a valid setup.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.",

However, deploying these models in critical infrastructures presents a major challenge, as concerns about data privacy prevent unrestricted data sharing. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a solution by enabling computations on encrypted data, but it remains incompatible with machine learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), due to their reliance on non-linear activation functions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes an optimized framework that replaces standard non-linear functions with homomorphically compatible approximations, ensuring secure computations while minimizing computational overhead. The proposed approach restructures the CNN architecture and introduces an efficient activation function approximation method to mitigate the performance trade-offs introduced by encryption. Experiments on CIFAR-10 achieve 94.4% accuracy with 2.42 s per single encrypted sample and 24,000 s per 10,000 encrypted samples, using a degree-4 polynomial and Softplus activation under CKKS, balancing accuracy and privacy.",

      "abstract": "While homomorphic encryption (HE) provides strong privacy protection, its high computational cost has restricted its application to simple tasks. Recently, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) applied to HE has shown promising performance for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML). However, when applied to more realistic scenarios such as batch inference, the HDC-based HE has still very high compute time as well as high encryption and data transmission overheads. To address this problem, we propose HDC with encrypted parameters (EP-HDC), which is a novel PPML approach featuring client-side HE, i.e., inference is performed on a client using a homomorphically encrypted model. Our EP-HDC can effectively mitigate the encryption and data transmission overhead, as well as providing high scalability with many clients while providing strong protection for user data and model parameters. In addition to application examples for our client-side PPML, we also present design space exploration involving quantization, architecture, and HE-related parameters. Our experimental results using the BFV scheme and the Face/Emotion datasets demonstrate that our method can improve throughput and latency of batch inference by orders of magnitude over previous PPML methods (36.52~1068x and 6.45~733x, respectively) with less than 1% accuracy degradation.",

The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing homomorphic operations to be applied.

However, various security and privacy challenges were identified in the literature that must be addressed to enable the safe and secure deployment of 6G-ITS and ensure people's trust in using these technologies.

It discusses the potential benefits of 6G technology in the transportation sector, including improved communication, device interoperability support, data analytic capabilities, and increased automation for different components, such as transportation management and communication systems. A taxonomy of different attack models in 6G-ITS is proposed, and a comparison of the security threats in 5G-ITS and 6G-ITS is provided, along with potential mitigating solutions.

Recent works have shown promising results for securing SL through the use of a novel paradigm, named Function Secret Sharing (FSS), in which servers obtain shares of a function they compute and operate on a public input hidden with a random mask. However, these works fall short in addressing the rising number of attacks which exist on SL. In SplitHappens, we expand the combination of FSS and SL to U-shaped SL. Similarly to other works, we are able to make use of the benefits of SL by reducing the communication and computational costs of FSS. However, a U-shaped SL provides a higher security guarantee than previous works, allowing a client to keep the labels of the training data secret, without having to share them with the server. Through this, we are able to generalize the security analysis of previous works and expand it to different attack vectors, such as modern model inversion attacks as well as label inference attacks. We tested our approach for two different convolutional neural networks on different datasets. These experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the training time as well as the communication costs when compared to simply using FSS while matching prior accuracy.",

CVQKD has the advantage of being compatible with standard telecom equipment, but at long distances has to deal with very low signal to noise ratios, which necessitates labour-intensive error correction. It is challenging to implement the error correction decoding in realtime. In this paper we introduce a random-codebook error correction method that is suitable for long range Gaussian-modulated CVQKD. We use likelihood ratio scoring with block rejection based on thresholding. For proof-technical reasons, the accept/reject decisions are communicated in encrypted form; in this way we avoid having to deal with non-Gaussian states in the analysis of the leakage. The error correction method is highly parallelisable, which is advantageous for realtime implementation. Under conservative assumptions on the computational resources, we predict a realtime key ratio of at least 8% of the Devetak-Winter value, which outperforms existing reconciliation schemes.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy. In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.",

While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.",

      "abstract": "The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.",

      "abstract": "The scalability of current quantum networks is limited due to noisy quantum components and high implementation costs, thereby limiting the security advantages that quantum networks provide over their classical counterparts. Quantum Augmented Networks (QuANets) address this by integrating quantum components in classical network infrastructure to improve robustness and end-to-end security. To enable such integration, Quantum Anonymous Notification (QAN) is a method to anonymously inform a receiver of an incoming quantum communication. Therefore, several quantum primitives will serve as core tools, namely, quantum voting, quantum anonymous protocols, quantum secret sharing, etc. However, all current quantum protocols can be compromised in the presence of several common channel noises. In this work, we propose an improved quantum anonymous notification (QAN) protocol that utilizes rotation operations on shared GHZ states to produce an anonymous notification in an n-user quantum-augmented network. We study the behavior of this modified QAN protocol under the dephasing noise model and observe stronger resilience to false notifications than earlier QAN approaches. The QAN framework is also proposed to be integrated with a machine-learning classifier, enhanced quantum-augmented network. Finally, we discuss how this notification layer integrates with QuANets so that receivers can allow switch-bypass handling of quantum payloads, reducing header-based information leakage and vulnerability to targeted interference at compromised switches.",

Eavesdropping detection is, therefore, a standard feature in all the proposed quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols. However, detection is often done by a statistical analysis of the outcome of multiple decoy rounds, and this causes a significant communication overhead. In our quest for a QSS protocol that works even in one round, we came across a one-shot secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu (Phys. Rev. A 2003). The scheme was designed to work over public channels without requiring multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping but it lacked a thorough security analysis. In this work we present a complete characterisation of the correctness and security properties of this framework. Our characterisation allowed us to improve the original protocol to be more resistant towards eavesdropping. However, we prove a couple of impossibility results, including one that dictates that complete security against an eavesdropper is not possible in this framework. Thus, it is not possible to design a perfect QSS using this framework.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks can convert ECG page images into analyzable waveforms, yet centralized training often conflicts with cross-institutional privacy and deployment constraints. A cross-silo federated digitization framework is presented that trains a full-model nnU-Net segmentation backbone without sharing images and aggregates updates across sites under realistic non-IID heterogeneity (layout, grid style, scanner profile, noise). The protocol integrates three standard server-side aggregators--FedAvg, FedProx, and FedAdam--and couples secure aggregation with central, user-level differential privacy to align utility with formal guarantees. Key features include: (i) end-to-end full-model training and synchronization across clients; (ii) secure aggregation so the server only observes a clipped, weighted sum once a participation threshold is met; (iii) central Gaussian DP with Renyi accounting applied post-aggregation for auditable user-level privacy; and (iv) a calibration-aware digitization pipeline comprising page normalization, trace segmentation, grid-leakage suppression, and vectorization to twelve-lead signals. Experiments on ECG pages rendered from PTB-XL show consistently faster convergence and higher late-round plateaus with adaptive server updates (FedAdam) relative to FedAvg and FedProx, while approaching centralized performance. The privacy mechanism maintains competitive accuracy while preventing exposure of raw images or per-client updates, yielding deployable, auditable guarantees suitable for multi-institution settings.",

To preserve the privacy of the participants, we derive our protocol based on secret sharing, which guarantees privacy in the honest-but-curious setting even when at most half of the parties cooperate to disclose the data. The protocol makes use of a forest of randomly generated SPNs, which is trained and weighted privately and can then be used for private inference on data points. Our experiments indicate that preserving the privacy of all participants does not decrease log-likelihood performance on both homogeneously and heterogeneously partitioned data. We furthermore show that our protocol's performance is comparable to current state-of-the-art SPN learners in homogeneously partitioned data settings. In terms of runtime and memory usage, we demonstrate that our implementation scales well when increasing the number of parties, comparing favorably to protocols for neural networks, when they are trained to reproduce the input-output behavior of SPNs.",

Unlike prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10% improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore, privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions.",

On the flip side, while classical key exchange can be achieved non-interactively (with two simultaneous messages between Alice and Bob), no non-interactive protocol is known that provides everlasting security, even using quantum information. In this work, we make progress on this problem. Our main technical contribution is a computational variant of the celebrated monogamy of entanglement game, where the secret is only computationally hidden from the players, rather than information-theoretically. In these settings, we prove a negligible bound on the maximal winning probability over all strategies. As a direct application, we obtain a non-interactive (simultaneous message) QKD protocol from any post-quantum classical non-interactive key exchange, which satisfies everlastingly secure assuming Alice and Bob agree on the same key. The protocol only uses EPR pairs and standard and Hadamard basis measurements, making it suitable for near-term quantum hardware. We also propose how to convert this protocol into a two-round protocol that satisfies the standard notion of everlasting security. Finally, we prove a no-go theorem which establishes that (in contrast to the case of ordinary multi-round QKD) entanglement is necessary for non-interactive QKD, i.e., the messages sent by Alice and Bob cannot both be unentangled with their respective quantum memories if the protocol is to be everlastingly secure.",

Crucially, the size of both messages and of the CRS is independent of the dimension of $\\mathbf{x}$. We present a construction of OTE with optimal complexity from the standard learning with errors (LWE) problem. Then we show how this new technical tool enables a host of cryptographic primitives, all with security reducible to LWE, such as: * Adaptively secure laconic function evaluation for depth-$D$ functions $f:\\{0, 1\\}^m\\rightarrow\\{0, 1\\}^\\ell$ with communication $m+\\ell+D\\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(\u03bb)$. * A trapdoor hash function for all functions. * An (optimally) succinct homomorphic secret sharing for all functions. * A rate-$1/2$ laconic oblivious transfer for batch messages, which is best possible. In particular, we obtain the first laconic function evaluation scheme that is adaptively secure from the standard LWE assumption, improving upon Quach, Wee, and Wichs (FOCS 2018).

This article first reviews recent advancements in model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, underscoring critical limitations, especially when dealing with non-IID textual data distributions. Current defense strategies predominantly employ distance or similarity-based outlier detection mechanisms, relying on the assumption that malicious updates markedly differ from benign statistical patterns. However, this assumption becomes inadequate against adaptive adversaries targeting billion-parameter LLMs. The article further investigates graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP), an emerging attack paradigm that exploits higher-order correlations among benign client gradients to craft malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate ones. GRMP can effectively circumvent advanced defense systems, causing substantial degradation in model accuracy and overall performance. Moreover, the article outlines a forward-looking research roadmap that emphasizes the necessity of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, specialized vulnerability metrics tailored for FedLLMs, and evaluation frameworks to enhance the robustness of federated language model deployments.",

Satellite-based links are important in QKD because they can reach distances that the best fiber systems cannot. However, links between satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and ground stations have a duration of only a few minutes, resulting in the generation of a small amount of secure keys. In this context, we investigate the optimization of the information reconciliation step of the QKD post-processing in order to generate as much secure key as possible. As a first step, we build an accurate model of the downlink signal and quantum bit error rate (QBER) during a complete satellite pass, which are time-varying due to three effects: (i) the varying link geometry over time, (ii) the scintillation effect, and (iii) the different signal intensities adopted in the Decoy-State protocol. Leveraging the a-priori information on the instantaneous QBER, we improve the efficiency of information reconciliation (IR) (i.e., the error correction phase) in the Decoy-State BB84 protocol, resulting in a secure key that is almost 3\\% longer for realistic scenarios.",

Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved.

      "abstract": "In two-party secret sharing scheme, values are typically encoded as unsigned integers $\\mathsf{uint}(x)$, whereas real-world applications often require computations on signed real numbers $\\mathsf{Real}(x)$. To enable secure evaluation of practical functions, it is essential to computing $\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ from shared inputs, as protocols take shares as input. At USENIX'25, Guo et al. proposed an efficient method for computing signed integer values $\\mathsf{int}(x)$ from shares, which can be extended to compute $\\mathsf{Real}(x)$. However, their approach imposes a restrictive input constraint $|x| < \\frac{L}{3}$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_L$, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we significantly relax this constraint to $|x| < B$ for any $B \\leq \\frac{L}{2}$, where $B = \\frac{L}{2}$ corresponding to the natural representable range in $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_L$. This relaxes the restrictions and enables the computation of $\\mathsf{Real}(x)$ with loose or no input constraints. Building upon this foundation, we present a generalized framework for designing secure protocols for a broad class of functions, including integer division ($\\lfloor \\frac{x}{d} \\rfloor$), trigonometric ($\\sin(x)$) and exponential ($e^{-x}$) functions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols achieve both high efficiency and high accuracy. Notably, our protocol for evaluating $e^{-x}$ reduces communication costs to approximately 31% of those in SirNN (S&P 21) and Bolt (S&P 24), with runtime speedups of up to $5.53 \\times$ and $3.09 \\times$, respectively. In terms of accuracy, our protocol achieves a maximum ULP error of $1.435$, compared to $2.64$ for SirNN and $8.681$ for Bolt.",

Rather than having a single secret key, this allows to distribute the ability to perform a cryptographic operation such as signing or encrypting. Threshold cryptographic operations are shared among different parties such that a threshold number of them must participate in order to run the operation. This makes the job of an attacker strictly more difficult in the sense that they would have to corrupt at least a threshold number of parties to breach the security. Most works in this field focus on asymmetric-key schemes that allow threshold signing or decrypting. We focus on the symmetric-key setting, allowing both threshold encryption and threshold decryption. Previous work relies on the presence of a trusted third party. Such a party may not exist in some use cases, and it represents a single point of failure. We propose to remove the requirement of a trusted third party by designing a dealer-free setup in which no entity can at any point obtain full knowledge of the secret keys. We implement a proof of concept of our construction in Python. We evaluate the proof of concept with timing metrics to compare to theoretical expectations and assess the cost in complexity of not relying on a trusted third party. While the setup phase suffers moderate additional cost, the encryption and decryption phases perform the same as the original algorithm.",

We develop a theoretical framework leveraging entropy-preserving operations and secret-shared verification to achieve provable security against quantum adversaries. Through entropy amplification techniques and quantum-resistant commitments, the protocol establishes $2^{128}$ quantum security guarantees under the quantum random oracle model. Key innovations include a confidentiality-preserving verification mechanism using distributed polynomial commitments, tightened min-entropy bounds with guaranteed non-negativity, and composable security proofs in the quantum universal composability framework. Unlike computational approaches, our method provides information-theoretic security without hardness assumptions while maintaining polynomial complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates resilience against known quantum attack vectors, including Grover-accelerated brute force and quantum memory attacks. The protocol achieves parameterization for 128-bit quantum security with efficient $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ communication complexity. Extensions to secure multiparty computation and quantum network applications are established, providing a foundation for long-term cryptographic security.",

      "abstract": "As 5G networks expand into critical infrastructure, secure and efficient user authentication is more important than ever. The 5G-AKA protocol, standardized by 3GPP in TS 33.501, is central to authentication in current 5G deployments. It provides mutual authentication, user privacy, and key secrecy. However, despite its adoption, 5G-AKA has known limitations in both security and performance. While it focuses on protecting privacy against passive attackers, recent studies show its vulnerabilities to active attacks. It also relies on a sequence number mechanism to prevent replay attacks, requiring perfect synchronization between the device and the core network. This stateful design adds complexity, causes desynchronization, and incurs extra communication overhead. More critically, 5G-AKA lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), exposing past communications if long-term keys are compromised-an increasing concern amid sophisticated threats. This paper proposes an enhanced authentication protocol that builds on 5G-AKA's design while addressing its shortcomings. First, we introduce a stateless version that removes sequence number reliance, reducing complexity while staying compatible with existing SIM cards and infrastructure. We then extend this design to add PFS with minimal cryptographic overhead. Both protocols are rigorously analyzed using ProVerif, confirming their compliance with all major security requirements, including resistance to passive and active attacks, as well as those defined by 3GPP and academic studies. We also prototype both protocols and evaluate their performance against 5G-AKA and 5G-AKA' (USENIX'21). Our results show the proposed protocols offer stronger security with only minor computational overhead, making them practical, future-ready solutions for 5G and beyond.",

      "abstract": "One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) introduced by Khurana and Tomer [STOC 2024] are a natural quantum analogue of one-way functions (OWFs), and one of the most fundamental primitives in ''Microcrypt'' where OWFs do not exist but quantum cryptography is possible. OWPuzzs are implied by almost all quantum cryptographic primitives, and imply several important applications such as non-interactive commitments and multi-party computations. A significant goal in the field of quantum cryptography is to base OWPuzzs on plausible assumptions that will not imply OWFs. In this paper, we base OWPuzzs on hardness of non-collapsing measurements. To that end, we introduce a new complexity class, $\\mathbf{SampPDQP}$, which is a sampling version of the decision class $\\mathbf{PDQP}$ introduced in [Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee, ITCS 2016]. We show that if $\\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is hard on average for quantum polynomial time, then OWPuzzs exist. $\\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ is the class of sampling problems that can be solved by a classical polynomial-time algorithm that can make a single query to a non-collapsing measurement oracle, which is a ''magical'' oracle that can sample measurement results on quantum states without collapsing the states. Such non-collapsing measurements are highly unphysical operations that should be hard to realize in quantum polynomial-time. We also study upperbounds of the hardness of $\\mathbf{SampPDQP}$. We introduce a new primitive, distributional collision-resistant puzzles (dCRPuzzs), which are a natural quantum analogue of distributional collision-resistant hashing [Dubrov and Ishai, STOC 2006]. We show that dCRPuzzs imply average-case hardness of $\\mathbf{SampPDQP}$ (and therefore OWPuzzs as well). We also show that two-message honest-statistically-hiding commitments with classical communication and one-shot signatures [Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, Zhandry, STOC 2020] imply dCRPuzzs.",

In this work, we focus on quantum cryptographic primitives with classical communication, referred to as QCCC primitives. Our main result shows that QCCC bit commitments and QCCC key agreement, cannot be constructed from pseudorandom unitaries in a black-box manner. Our core technical contribution is to show (in a variety of settings) the difficulty of distinguishing identical versus independent Haar unitaries by separable channels.

While 5G AKA improves upon previous generations by concealing subscriber identities, it remains vulnerable to replay-based synchronization and linkability threats under realistic adversary models. This paper provides a unified analysis of the standardized 5G AKA flow, identifying several vulnerabilities and highlighting how each exploits protocol behavior to compromise user privacy. To address these risks, we present five lightweight mitigation strategies. We demonstrate through prototype implementation and testing that these enhancements strengthen resilience against linkability attacks with minimal computational and signaling overhead. Among the solutions studied, those introducing a UE-generated nonce emerge as the most promising, effectively neutralizing the identified tracking and correlation attacks with negligible additional overhead. Integrating this extension as an optional feature to the standard 5G AKA protocol offers a backward-compatible, low-overhead path toward a more privacy-preserving authentication framework for both commercial and military 5G deployments.",

However, this claim has only been analysed in theoretical models and thus it is unclear how efficient MLS is in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, practical decisions such as the chosen Delivery Service and paradigm can also influence the efficiency and evolution of an MLS group. In this work we analyse MLS from an empirical viewpoint: we provide real-world measurements for metrics such as commit generation and processing times and message sizes under different conditions. In order to obtain these results we have developed a highly configurable environment for empirical evaluations of MLS through the simulation of MLS clients.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel measurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of reciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise, asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections -- all of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the quantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors, further limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for secret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust and reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover hidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models for efficient key agreement. Our approach eliminates the need for quantization and effectively captures channel randomness. It achieves a 5x improvement in key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks, providing a secure and efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.",

To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive and efficient authentication and key agreement scheme (AEAKA) for Cloud-Edge-Device IoT environments. This scheme is highly adaptive and scalable, capable of automatically and dynamically initiating different authentication methods based on device requirements. Additionally, it employs an edge-assisted authentication approach to reduce the load on third-party trust authorities. Furthermore, we introduce a hash-based algorithm for the authentication protocol, ensuring a lightweight method suitable for a wide range of resource-constrained devices while maintaining security. AEAKA ensures that entities use associated authentication credentials, enhancing the privacy of the authentication process. Security proofs and performance analyses demonstrate that AEAKA outperforms other methods in terms of security and authentication efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Messaging Layer security (MLS) and its underlying Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA) protocol allows a group of users to share a cryptographic secret in a dynamic manner, such that the secret is modified in member insertions and deletions. Although this flexibility makes MLS ideal for implementations in distributed environments, a number of issues need to be overcome. Particularly, the use of digital certificates for authentication in a group goes against the group members' privacy. In this work we provide an alternative method of authentication in which the solicitors, instead of revealing their identity, only need to prove possession of certain attributes, dynamically defined by the group, to become a member. Instead of digital certificates, we employ Attribute-Based Credentials accompanied with Selective Disclosure in order to reveal the minimum required amount of information and to prevent attackers from linking the activity of a user through multiple groups. We formally define a CGKA variant named Attribute-Authenticated Continuous Group Key Agreement (AA-CGKA) and provide security proofs for its properties of Requirement Integrity, Unforgeability and Unlinkability. We also provide guidelines for an integration of our construction in MLS.",

We study feasibility and limitations of cryptographic primitives in this model and its variants: - We present a construction of pseudorandom function-like states with security against computationally unbounded adversaries, as long as the adversaries only receive (a priori) bounded number of copies. By suitably instantiating the CHS model, we obtain a new approach to construct pseudorandom function-like states in the plain model. - We present separations between pseudorandom function-like states (with super-logarithmic length) and quantum cryptographic primitives, such as interactive key agreement and bit commitment, with classical communication. To show these separations, we prove new results on the indistinguishability of identical versus independent Haar states against LOCC (local operations, classical communication) adversaries.",

However, the rapid adoption of the Internet of Medical Things also introduces significant security challenges that must be effectively addressed to preserve patient privacy, protect sensitive medical data, and ensure the overall reliability and safety of Internet of Medical Things systems. In this context, a key agreement protocol is used to securely establish shared cryptographic keys between interconnected medical devices and the central system, ensuring confidential and authenticated communication. Recently Chen et al. proposed a lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol for the Internet of health things. In this article, we provide a descriptive analysis of their proposed scheme and prove that Chen et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to Known session-specific temporary information attacks and stolen verifier attacks.",

In particular, we distinguish between authentication factors that are verified against the blockchain and the ones verified locally (or against a centralized party). With this in mind, we define notions for $k-factor$ authentication against the blockchain and $k-factor$ authentication against the authentication factors. Based on these notions, we propose a classification of authentication schemes. We extend our classification to accommodate the threshold signatures and signing transactions by centralized parties (such as exchanges or co-signing services). Finally, we apply our classification to existing wallet solutions, which we compare based on various security and key-management features.",

      "abstract": "Vote-based blockchains construct a state machine replication (SMR) system among participating nodes, using Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols to transition from one state to another. Currently, they rely on either synchronous or partially synchronous networks with leader-based coordination or costly Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocols in asynchronous settings, making them impractical for large-scale asynchronous applications. To make Asynchronous SMR scalable, this paper proposes a \\emph{validated strong} BFT consensus model that allows leader-based coordination in asynchronous settings. Our BFT consensus model offers the same level of tolerance as binary byzantine agreement but does not demand consistency among honest nodes before they vote. An SMR using our model allows nodes to operate in different, tentative, but mutually exclusive states until they eventually converge on the same state. We propose an asynchronous BFT protocol for vote-based blockchains employing our consensus model to address several critical challenges: how to ensure that nodes eventually converge on the same state across voting rounds, how to assure that a blockchain will steadily progress through epochs while reaching consensus for previous epochs, and how to maintain robust byzantine fault tolerance. Our protocol greatly reduces message complexity and is the first one to achieve linear view changes without relying on threshold signatures. We prove that an asynchronous blockchain built on our protocol can operate with the \\emph{same} simplicity and efficiency as partially synchronous blockchains built on, e.g. HotStuff-2. This facilitates deploying asynchronous blockchains across large-scale networks.",

DSNs bring together affordable storage resources from around the world to provide robust, decentralized storage services for tens of thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). However, existing DSNs do not offer verifiability when implementing erasure coding for redundant storage, making them vulnerable to Byzantine encoders. Additionally, there is a lack of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for optimal resilience in DSNs. This paper introduces BFT-DSN, a Byzantine fault-tolerant decentralized storage network designed to address these challenges. BFT-DSN combines storage-weighted BFT consensus with erasure coding and incorporates homomorphic fingerprints and weighted threshold signatures for decentralized verification. The implementation of BFT-DSN demonstrates its comparable performance in terms of storage cost and latency as well as superior performance in Byzantine resilience when compared to existing industrial decentralized storage networks.",

Whilst a legitimate RIS can yield beneficial impacts, including increased channel randomness to enhance PL-SKG, a malicious RIS can poison legitimate channels and crack almost all existing PL-SKGs. In this work, we propose an adversarial learning framework that addresses Man-in-the-middle RIS (MITM-RIS) eavesdropping which can exist between legitimate parties, namely Alice and Bob. First, the theoretical mutual information gap between legitimate pairs and MITM-RIS is deduced. From this, Alice and Bob leverage adversarial learning to learn a common feature space that assures no mutual information overlap with MITM-RIS. Next, to explain the trained legitimate common feature generator, we aid signal processing interpretation of black-box neural networks using a symbolic explainable AI (xAI) representation. These symbolic terms of dominant neurons aid the engineering of feature designs and the validation of the learned common feature space. Simulation results show that our proposed adversarial learning- and symbolic-based PL-SKGs can achieve high key agreement rates between legitimate users, and is further resistant to an MITM-RIS Eve with the full knowledge of legitimate feature generation (NNs or formulas). This therefore paves the way to secure wireless communications with untrusted reflective devices in future 6G.",
