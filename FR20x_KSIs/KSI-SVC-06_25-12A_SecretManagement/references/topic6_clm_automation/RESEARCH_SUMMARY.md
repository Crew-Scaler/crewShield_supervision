## Key Findings for CLM Automation

### Current State of Research
1. **Service mesh adoption** driving demand for automated mTLS certificate management
2. **Certificate status checking** evolving toward hybrid and decentralized models
3. **Post-quantum readiness** becoming critical consideration for PKI infrastructure
4. **Policy-as-code** emerging as standard for security automation in cloud-native environments
5. **Hardware-based trust** gaining traction for certificate issuance security

### Research Gaps Identified
1. Limited focus on **zero-downtime certificate rotation** at scale
2. Few papers addressing **certificate discovery** in ephemeral infrastructure
3. **Let's Encrypt and ACME protocol** research surprisingly limited in 2024-2025
4. **Multi-cloud certificate management** underrepresented in academic literature
5. **Operational metrics** for CLM automation rarely quantified

### Industry Implications
