**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets; refined per FedRAMP ADR feedback
**Filtering Criteria:** Questions directly addressing DoS/DDoS detection and mitigation effectiveness for AI-powered attacks. Removed: compliance automation (CMT KSI), SLA/contractual terms (INR KSI), training/maturity (CED KSI), third-party vendor risk (3IR KSI), cost/business impact, and future innovation. Focused scope on: AI-powered attack detection (behavioral mimicry, adaptive attacks, multi-vector), anomaly detection algorithms, sub-10s detection latency, sub-60s mitigation SLA, always-on protection architecture, economic DoS (DoW) defense, ML/AI model validation and adversarial robustness, incident response speed, transparency and threat evolution.

**Question Count:** 27 (down from 40)
- Sections 1-6: 19 questions (AI-powered attacks, anomaly detection, infrastructure, DoW, ML robustness, federated defense)
- Sections 7-11: 8 questions (SLA accountability, incident response, continuous improvement, transparency, threat intelligence)

**Research Basis:** 204 papers synthesized into 7 thematic clusters emphasizing: AI agents & LLM-based security (21 papers), adversarial attacks & AI evasion (39 papers), anomaly detection (31 papers), DDoS detection & mitigation (45 papers), economic DoS (38 papers), deep learning & advanced ML (40 papers), federated learning & quantum (21 papers). Key findings validated: Sub-10s detection with streaming infrastructure (Kafka/Flink <1ms, ML <5s), 95-99% ML accuracy vs. <85% signature-based, eBPF/XDP >97% mitigation effectiveness, 4.35x billing inflation via DoW, 99.99% accuracy with LLM-based SDN defense, 3-4x replication for Byzantine consensus.
