  "abstract": "The proliferation of cloud-integrated IoT systems has intensified exposure to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks due to the expanded attack surface, heterogeneous device behaviors, and limited edge protection. However, DDoS detection in this context remains challenging because of complex traffic dynamics, severe class imbalance, and scarce labeled data. While recent methods have explored solutions to address class imbalance, many still struggle to generalize under limited supervision and dynamic traffic conditions. To overcome these challenges, we propose MixGAN, a hybrid detection method that integrates conditional generation, semi-supervised learning, and robust feature extraction. Specifically, to handle complex temporal traffic patterns, we design a 1-D WideResNet backbone composed of temporal convolutional layers with residual connections, which effectively capture local burst patterns in traffic sequences. To alleviate class imbalance and label scarcity, we use a pretrained CTGAN to generate synthetic minority-class (DDoS attack) samples that complement unlabeled data. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of noisy pseudo-labels, we introduce a MixUp-Average-Sharpen (MAS) strategy that constructs smoothed and sharpened targets by averaging predictions over augmented views and reweighting them towards high-confidence classes. Experiments on NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 demonstrate that MixGAN achieves up to 2.5% higher accuracy and 4% improvement in both TPR and TNR compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its robustness in large-scale IoT-cloud environments.
