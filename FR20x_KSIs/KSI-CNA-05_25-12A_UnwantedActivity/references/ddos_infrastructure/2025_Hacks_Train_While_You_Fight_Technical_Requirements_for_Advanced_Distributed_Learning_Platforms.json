  "abstract": "\"Train While You Fight\" (TWYF) advocates for continuous learning that occurs during operations, not just before or after. This paper examines the technical requirements that advanced distributed learning (ADL) platforms must meet to support TWYF, and how existing software engineering patterns can fulfill these requirements. Using a Design Science Research approach, we (i) derive challenges from PfPC/NATO documentation and recent practice, (ii) define solution objectives, and (iii) conduct a systematic mapping from challenges to proven patterns. We identify seven technical challenges: interoperability, resilience, multilingual support, data security and privacy, scalability, platform independence, and modularity. We illustrate the patterns with a national use case from the German armed forces.",
