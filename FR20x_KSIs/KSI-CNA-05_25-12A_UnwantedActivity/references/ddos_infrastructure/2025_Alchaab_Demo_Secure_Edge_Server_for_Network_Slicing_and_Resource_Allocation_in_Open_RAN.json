  "abstract": "Next-Generation Radio Access Networks (NGRAN) aim to support diverse vertical applications with strict security, latency, and Service-Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. These demands introduce challenges in securing the infrastructure, allocating resources dynamically, and enabling real-time reconfiguration. This demo presents SnSRIC, a secure and intelligent network slicing framework that mitigates a range of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in Open RAN environments. SnSRIC incorporates an AI-driven xApp that dynamically allocates Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to active users while enforcing slice-level security. The system detects anomalous behavior, distinguishes between benign and malicious devices, and uses the E2 interface to throttle rogue signaling while maintaining service continuity for legitimate users.",
