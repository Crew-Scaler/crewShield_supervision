  "abstract": "Innovative solutions to cyber security issues are shaped by the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats. Automating the mitigation of these threats can be achieved through a new methodology that addresses the domain of mitigation automation, which is often overlooked. This literature overview emphasizes the lack of scholarly work focusing specifically on automated cyber threat mitigation, particularly in addressing challenges beyond detection. The proposed methodology comprise of the development of an automatic cyber threat mitigation framework tailored for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This framework adopts a multi-layer security approach, utilizing smart devices at the device layer, and leveraging fog network and cloud computing layers for deeper understanding and technological adaptability. Initially, firewall rule-based packet inspection is conducted on simulated attack traffic to filter out DoS packets, forwarding legitimate packets to the fog. The methodology emphasizes the integration of fog detection through statistical and behavioral analysis, specification-based detection, and deep packet inspection, resulting in a comprehensive cyber protection system. Furthermore, cloud-level inspection is performed to confirm and mitigate attacks using firewalls, enhancing strategic defense and increasing robustness against cyber threats. These enhancements enhance understanding of the research framework's practical implementation and assessment strategies, substantiating its importance in addressing current cyber security challenges and shaping future automation mitigation approaches.",
