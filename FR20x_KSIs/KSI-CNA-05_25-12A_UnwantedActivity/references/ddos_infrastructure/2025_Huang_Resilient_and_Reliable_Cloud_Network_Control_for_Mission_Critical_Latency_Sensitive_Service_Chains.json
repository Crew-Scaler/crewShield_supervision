  "abstract": "The proliferation of mission-critical latency-sensitive services has intensified the demand for next-generation cloud-integrated networks to guarantee both reliable and resilient service delivery. While reliability imposes timely-throughput requirements, i.e., percentage of packets to be delivered within a prescribed per-packet deadline, resilience relates to the network's ability to swiftly recover timely-throughput performance following an outage event, such as node or link failures. While recent studies have increasingly focused on designing reliable network control policies, a comprehensive solution that combines reliable and resilient network control has yet to be fully explored. This paper formulates the multi-commodity least-cost resilient and reliable network control (MC-LC-ResRNC) problem as a stochastic control problem with long and short-term timely throughput constraints. We then present a solution through the Multi-Commodity Resilient and Reliable Cloud Network Control (MC-ResRCNC) algorithm and show through numerical experiments that it jointly ensures reliability under normal conditions and resilience upon network failure.",
