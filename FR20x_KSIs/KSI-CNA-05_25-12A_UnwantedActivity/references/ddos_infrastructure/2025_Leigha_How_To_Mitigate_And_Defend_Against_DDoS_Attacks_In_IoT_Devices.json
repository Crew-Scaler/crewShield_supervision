  "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly prevalent and dangerous in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, primarily due to the low-security configurations of many connected devices. This paper analyzes the nature and impact of DDoS attacks such as those launched by the Mirai botnet, and proposes layered mitigation strategies tailored to IoT environments. Key solutions explored include IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULA), edge computing, software-defined networking (SDN), honeypot deception, and machine learning-based intrusion detection systems. The paper aims to help engineers and researchers understand and implement practical countermeasures to protect IoT infrastructures.",
