✓ Privacy preservation via federated learning increasingly important

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
✓ Early-exit architectures for adaptive computation
✓ Model compression (pruning, quantization) for speed
✓ Hardware acceleration (P4, FPGA, GPU) essential
✓ Synthetic data generation for class balancing

RESEARCH GAPS IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION:

1. Multi-vector attack scenarios (combined DDoS types)
   - Most papers focus on single attack types
   - Real-world attacks increasingly use multiple vectors

2. Standardized benchmarking
   - Inconsistent evaluation across papers
   - Need for unified performance comparison framework

3. Real-world deployment validation
   - Limited operational studies
   - Gap between lab results and production performance

4. Human-in-the-loop integration
   - Automated systems need analyst oversight
   - Balance between automation and human judgment

5. Cross-domain transfer learning
   - Models trained on one network rarely transfer
   - Need for domain adaptation techniques

6. Privacy-preserving techniques
   - Sensitive network data requires protection
   - Federated learning adoption still limited
