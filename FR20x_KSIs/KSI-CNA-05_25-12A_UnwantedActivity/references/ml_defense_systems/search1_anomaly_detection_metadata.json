    "summary": "Accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is fundamental to service computing, providing essential data-driven guidance for service selection and ensuring superior user experiences. However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. Such reliance not only leads to the intractability of explicit graph construction in large-scale scenarios but also limits the modeling of implicit topological relations",

    "summary": "This paper proposes using the Linux kernel ftrace framework, particularly the function graph tracer, to generate informative system level data for machine learning (ML) applications. Experiments on a real world encryption detection task demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed features across several learning algorithms. The learner faces the problem of detecting encryption activities across a large dataset of files, using function call traces and graph based features. Empirical results highligh",

    "summary": "Biochemical discovery increasingly relies on classifying molecular structures when the consequences of different errors are highly asymmetric. In mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, misclassifying a harmful compound as benign can trigger substantial scientific, regulatory, and health risks, whereas false alarms primarily increase laboratory workload. Modern representations transform molecular graphs into persistence image tensors that preserve multiscale geometric and topological structure, yet ex",

In this work, we built a hybrid search pipeline that combines matched filtering and deep learning to identify stellar-mass binary black hole candidates from detector strain data. We first present results from a targeted injection study to benchmar",
