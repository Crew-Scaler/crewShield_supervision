  "abstract": "The integration of unmanned platforms equipped with advanced sensors promises to enhance situational awareness and mitigate the \"fog of war\" in military operations. However, managing the vast influx of data from these platforms poses a significant challenge for Command and Control (C2) systems. This study presents a novel multi-agent learning framework to address this challenge. Our method enables autonomous and secure communication between agents and humans, which in turn enables real-time form",
