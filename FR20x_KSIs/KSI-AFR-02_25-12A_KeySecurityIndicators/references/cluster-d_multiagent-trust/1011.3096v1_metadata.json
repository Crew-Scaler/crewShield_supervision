  "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) and B3G/4G communication are promoting the pervasive mobile services with its advanced features. However, security problems are also baffled the development. This paper proposes a trust model to protect the user's security. The billing or trust operator works as an agent to provide a trust authentication for all the service providers. The services are classified by sensitive value calculation. With the value, the user's trustiness for corresponding service can be obtaine",
