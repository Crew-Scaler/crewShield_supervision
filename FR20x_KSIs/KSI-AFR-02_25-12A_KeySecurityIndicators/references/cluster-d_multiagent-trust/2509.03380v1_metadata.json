  "abstract": "Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment, with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control of information. We provide an illustrati",
