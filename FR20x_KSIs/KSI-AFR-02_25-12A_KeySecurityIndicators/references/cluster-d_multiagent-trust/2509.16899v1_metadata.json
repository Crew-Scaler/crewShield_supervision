  "abstract": "The interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs) for critical missions, including transportation, rescue, surveillance, reconnaissance, and mapping, is growing rapidly due to their significant safety and mobility benefits. AVs consist of complex software systems that leverage artificial intelligence (AI), sensor fusion algorithms, and real-time data processing. Additionally, AVs are becoming increasingly reliant on open-source software supply chains, such as open-source packages, third-party software c",
