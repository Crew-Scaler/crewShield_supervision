  "abstract": "We present Operand Quant, a single-agent, IDE-based architecture for autonomous machine learning engineering (MLE). Operand Quant departs from conventional multi-agent orchestration frameworks by consolidating all MLE lifecycle stages -- exploration, modeling, experimentation, and deployment -- within a single, context-aware agent. On the MLE-Benchmark (2025), Operand Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the hi",
