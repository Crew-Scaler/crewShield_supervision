  "abstract": "The protocols of distributed consensus normally aim to tolerate different types of faults including crash faults and byzantine faults that occur in the distributed systems. However, the dynamic network topology and stochastic wireless channels may cause the same trustworthy system to suffer both crash fault and byzantine fault. This article proposes the concept of a distributed consensus autonomous switch mechanism in trustworthy autonomous systems (D-CAST) to reach the different fault tolerance",
