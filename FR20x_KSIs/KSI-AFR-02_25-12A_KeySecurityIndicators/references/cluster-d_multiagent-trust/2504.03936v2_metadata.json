  "abstract": "Simple commit-reveal beacons are vulnerable to last-revealer strategies, and existing descriptions often leave accountability and recovery mechanisms unspecified for practical deployments. We present Commit-Reveal$^2$, a layered design for blockchain deployments that cryptographically randomizes the final reveal order, together with a concrete accountability and fallback mechanism that we implement as smart-contract logic. The protocol is architected as a hybrid system, where routine coordinatio",
