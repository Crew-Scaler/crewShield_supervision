  "abstract": "Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) improves traffic management and reduce the amount of road accidents by providing safety applications. However, VANETs are vulnerable to variety of security attacks from malicious entities. An authentication is an integral a neighborhood of trust establishment and secure communications between vehicles. The Road-side Unit (RSU) evaluates trust-value and the Agent Trusted Authority (ATA) helps in computing the trust-value of auto supported its reward-points. The ",
