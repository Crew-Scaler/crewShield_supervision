  "abstract": "CI/CD systems have become privileged automation agents in modern infrastructure, but their identity is still based on secrets or temporary credentials passed between systems. In enterprise environments, these platforms are centralized and shared across teams, often with broad cloud permissions and limited isolation. These conditions introduce risk, especially in the era of supply chain attacks, where implicit trust and static credentials leave systems exposed. This paper describes the shift from",
