  "abstract": "Verification using SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) is one of the most popular methods for detecting circuit design vulnerabilities. However, with the globalization of integrated circuit design and the continuous upgrading of security requirements, the SVA development model has exposed major limitations. It is not only inefficient in development, but also unable to effectively deal with the increasing number of security vulnerabilities in modern complex integrated circuits. In response to these ch",
