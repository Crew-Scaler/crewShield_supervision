  "abstract": "Current DAO governance praxis limits organizational expressivity and reduces complex organizational decisions to token-weighted voting due to on-chain computational limits. This paper proposes verifiable off-chain computation (leveraging Verifiable Services, TEEs, and ZK proofs) as a framework to transcend these constraints while maintaining cryptoeconomic security. This paper explores three novel governance mechanisms: (1) attestation-based systems that compute multi-dimensional stakeholder leg",
