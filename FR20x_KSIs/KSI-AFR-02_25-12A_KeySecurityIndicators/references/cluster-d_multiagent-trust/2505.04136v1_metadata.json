  "abstract": "We develop and apply epistemic tests to various decentralized governance methods as well as to study the impact of participation. These tests probe the ability to reach a correct outcome when there is one. We find that partial abstention is a strong governance method from an epistemic standpoint compared to alternatives such as various forms of ``transfer delegation\" in which voters explicitly transfer some or all of their voting rights to others. We make a stronger case for multi-step transfer ",
