  "abstract": "Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Casc",
