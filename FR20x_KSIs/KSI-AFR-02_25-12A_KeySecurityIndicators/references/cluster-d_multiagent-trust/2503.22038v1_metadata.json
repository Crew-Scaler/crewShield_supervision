  "abstract": "Phishing attacks remain a critical cybersecurity threat. Attackers constantly refine their methods, making phishing emails harder to detect. Traditional detection methods, including rule-based systems and supervised machine learning models, either rely on predefined patterns like blacklists, which can be bypassed with slight modifications, or require large datasets for training and still can generate false positives and false negatives. In this work, we propose a multi-agent large language model",
