  "abstract": "Fifth Generation (5G) telecommunication system is going to deliver a flexible radio access network (RAN). Security functions such as authorization, authentication and accounting (AAA) are expected to be distributed from central clouds to edge clouds. We propose a novel architectural security solution that applies to 5G networks. It is called Trust Zone (TZ) that is designed as an enhancement of the 5G AAA in the edge cloud. TZ also provides an autonomous and decentralized security policy for dif",
