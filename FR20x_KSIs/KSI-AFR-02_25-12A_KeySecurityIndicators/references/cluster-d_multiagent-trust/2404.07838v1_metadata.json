  "abstract": "We consider a multi-agent system where agents aim to achieve a consensus despite interactions with malicious agents that communicate misleading information. Physical channels supporting communication in cyberphysical systems offer attractive opportunities to detect malicious agents, nevertheless, trustworthiness indications coming from the channel are subject to uncertainty and need to be treated with this in mind. We propose a resilient consensus protocol that incorporates trust observations fr",
