  "abstract": "Keeping software systems up to date is essential to avoid technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and the rigidity typical of legacy systems. However, updating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone process. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding systems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy, across a dataset of ten client applications",
