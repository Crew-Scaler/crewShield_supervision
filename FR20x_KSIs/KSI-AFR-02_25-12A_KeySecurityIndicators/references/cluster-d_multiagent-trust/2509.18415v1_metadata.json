  "abstract": "The proliferation of autonomous software agents necessitates rigorous frameworks for establishing secure and verifiable agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions, particularly when such agents are instantiated as non-human identities(NHIs). We extend the A2A paradigm [1 , 2] by introducing a cryptographically grounded mechanism for lineage verification, wherein the provenance and evolution of NHIs are anchored in append-only Merkle tree structures modeled after Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.
