  "abstract": "The integration of edge computing in next-generation mobile networks is bringing low-latency and high-bandwidth ubiquitous connectivity to a myriad of cyber-physical systems. This will further boost the increasing intelligence that is being embedded at the edge in various types of autonomous systems, where collaborative machine learning has the potential to play a significant role. This paper discusses some of the challenges in multi-agent distributed deep reinforcement learning that can occur i",
