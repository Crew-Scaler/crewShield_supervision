**Authors:** Sandro Rodriguez Garzon, Awid Vaziry, Enis Mert Kuzu...
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02841v2

**Abstract:**
> A fundamental limitation of current LLM-based AI agents is their inability to build differentiated trust among each other at the onset of an agent-to-agent dialogue. However, autonomous and interoperable trust establishment becomes essential once agents start to operate beyond isolated environments and engage in dialogues across individual or organizational boundaries. A promising way to fill this...
