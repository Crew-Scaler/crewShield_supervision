  "abstract": "The maritime industry is governed by stringent environmental regulations, most notably the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Ensuring compliance with these regulations is difficult due to low inspection rates and the risk of data fabrication. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure blockchain-assisted framework for real-time maritime environmental compliance monitoring. By integrating IoT and shipboard sensors with blockchain technology, ",
