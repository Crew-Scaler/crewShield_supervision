  "abstract": "Operational Technology Cybersecurity (OTCS) continues to be a dominant challenge for critical infrastructure such as railways. As these systems become increasingly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to digitalization, effective documentation and compliance processes are essential to protect these safety-critical systems. This paper proposes a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-stage retrieval to enhance the compliance verification process against standards like I",
