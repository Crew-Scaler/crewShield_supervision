  "abstract": "Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automated code generation, yet their statistical nature and black-box characteristics create significant semantic gaps manifested through syntax errors, semantic hallucinations, and reliability concerns. This position paper argues that principled integration of Programming Language (PL) techniques is essential for bridging these gaps. Through structured program representations, formal correctness guarantees, and robust verificati",
