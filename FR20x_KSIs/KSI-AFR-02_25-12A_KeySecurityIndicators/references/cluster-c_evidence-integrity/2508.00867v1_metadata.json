  "abstract": "This article explores the integration of AI-generated subject terms into library cataloging, focusing on validation through the Library of Congress Linked Data Service. It examines the challenges of traditional subject cataloging under the Library of Congress Subject Headings system, including inefficiencies and cataloging backlogs. While generative AI shows promise in expediting cataloging workflows, studies reveal significant limitations in the accuracy of AI-assigned subject headings. The art",
