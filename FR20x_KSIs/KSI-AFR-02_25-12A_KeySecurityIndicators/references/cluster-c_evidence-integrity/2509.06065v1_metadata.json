  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption. Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet they are primarily available in English, leaving a gap in evaluating LLMs in low-resource languages. To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models were assessed using a binary-choice f",
