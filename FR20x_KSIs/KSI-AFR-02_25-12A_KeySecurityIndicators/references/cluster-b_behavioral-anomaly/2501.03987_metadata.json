  "summary": "Cloud IAM events arrive as high-velocity streams requiring real-time anomaly detection. We present a streaming ML pipeline that processes millions of IAM events daily while maintaining <100ms detection latency. Our system uses online learning algorithms (Hoeffding trees, mini-batch neural networks) that adapt to evolving behavior patterns without batch retraining. Evaluation shows comparable accuracy to batch methods while achieving real-time detection capability.",
