  "summary": "Traditional verification happens once at agent deployment; we present continuous verification that monitors agent behavior throughout its lifetime. Our framework continuously assesses whether agents maintain expected behavioral characteristics and revokes privileges when behavior deviates. The system uses adaptive thresholds that adjust based on operational context (load, time-of-day, seasonal factors). Response actions include throttling, isolation, and automatic rollback. Evaluation shows 88% of attacks caught before reaching critical resources.",
