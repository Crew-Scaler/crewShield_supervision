  "summary": "Insider threats take on new dimensions when agents can be compromised to perform unauthorized actions at scale. We present behavioral analytics for detecting compromised agents mimicking insider threat patterns. Our system analyzes: excessive data exfiltration, unusual resource access, privilege boundary violations, and suspicious external communications. Machine learning models trained on legitimate behavior detect insider-threat-like activity with 91% accuracy. The system provides forensic evidence linking agent compromise back to initial attack vector.",
