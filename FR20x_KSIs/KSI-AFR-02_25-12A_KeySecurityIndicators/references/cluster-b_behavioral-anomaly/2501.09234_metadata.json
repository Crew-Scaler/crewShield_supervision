  "summary": "Non-human identities (service accounts, agents, applications) exhibit fundamentally different behavior patterns than human users. Traditional user anomaly detection systems perform poorly on these identities. We present identity-centric anomaly detection specifically tailored to non-human behavior characteristics: highly predictable patterns, rapid decision-making, and resource-intensive operations. Our system uses machine learning ensemble methods combining behavioral, temporal, and resource-based features. Cloud provider testing shows 92% detection rate for unauthorized activities.",
