  "summary": "AI agents can be targets of poisoning attacks where legitimate behavior patterns are corrupted. We present behavior profile learning that captures fine-grained behavioral signatures and detects poisoning attempts. Our system identifies when agent behavior deviates from established profiles while distinguishing legitimate updates from attack-induced changes. We use ensemble methods combining supervised and unsupervised approaches. Evaluation against 20 poisoning attack scenarios shows >94% detection accuracy.",
