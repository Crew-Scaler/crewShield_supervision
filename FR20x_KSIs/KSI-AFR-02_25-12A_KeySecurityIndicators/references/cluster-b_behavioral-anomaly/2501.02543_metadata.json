  "summary": "Comprehensive anomaly detection requires multiple signal sources: behavioral logs, resource metrics, network traffic, and audit trails. We present a multi-view fusion framework that combines signals from heterogeneous sources. Our system uses ensemble learning to weight different views based on reliability. Integration across behavioral, infrastructure, and network layers enables detection of sophisticated attacks. Evaluation shows multi-view approach catches 97% of attacks vs 85% for single-view approaches.",
