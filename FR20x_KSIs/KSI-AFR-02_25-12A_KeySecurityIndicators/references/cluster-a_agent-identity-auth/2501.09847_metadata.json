  "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework for implementing workload identity federation in distributed AI systems. We propose an OIDC-based architecture that enables secure authentication of autonomous agents across cloud infrastructure without relying on long-lived credentials. Our approach integrates with major cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and Azure. We demonstrate 40% reduction in credential management overhead and improved security posture through ephemeral token generation. The framework includes practical implementation details for containerized agents and supports dynamic token rotation with sub-second latency.",
