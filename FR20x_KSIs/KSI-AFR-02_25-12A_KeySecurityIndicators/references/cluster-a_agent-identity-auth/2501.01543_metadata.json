  "summary": "OpenID Connect (OIDC) provides a robust foundation for agent orchestration authentication. We present a production-ready OIDC implementation specifically optimized for autonomous agent systems with multi-step authorization flows, agent-to-agent trust relationships, and dynamic scope management. Our system handles 10K+ concurrent agent authentication requests with <50ms latency. We address unique challenges including agent impersonation prevention, service-to-service token exchange, and cross-organizational agent delegation.",
