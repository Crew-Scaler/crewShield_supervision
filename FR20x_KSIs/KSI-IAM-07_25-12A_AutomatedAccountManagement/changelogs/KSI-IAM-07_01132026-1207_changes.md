**Summary of Task 2 Changes**: This iteration applies semantic consolidation to merge related questions while maintaining breadth of coverage. Key consolidations include: (1) Provisioning/deprovisioning metrics merged (Cluster 1); (2) Identity discovery metrics consolidated (Cluster 2); (3) Credential lifecycle management unified (Cluster 4); (4) Privileged agent governance consolidated (Cluster 5); (5) Delegation chain mechanics merged (Cluster 6); (6) Continuous authorization mechanisms unified (Cluster 7); (7) Significant audit/compliance evidence consolidation (Cluster 8). Cluster 3 (JIT/ABAC) maintained at 8 questions due to distinct technical concerns. Result: 38% reduction from original 85 questions while maintaining complete coverage of KSI-IAM-07 scope (53 questions vs. 85 original).

**Next Steps**: This fine-tuned question library provides focused, non-redundant coverage of core account lifecycle management automation for AI agents. CSP-specific patterns, templates, and benchmarking guidance have been appropriately relocated to specialized KSIs (CMT-01 for monitoring/detection; CED-02 for training and organizational readiness).
