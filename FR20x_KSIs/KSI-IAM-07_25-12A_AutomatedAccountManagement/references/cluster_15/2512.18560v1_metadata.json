  "published": "2025-12-21T01:36:24Z",
  "summary": "Sensor data in IoT (Internet of Things) systems is vulnerable to tampering or falsification when transmitted through untrusted services. This is critical because such data increasingly underpins real-world decisions in domains such as logistics, healthcare, and other critical infrastructure. We propose a general method for secure sensor-data logging in which tamper-evident devices periodically sign readouts, link data using redundant hash chains, and submit cryptographic evidence to a blockchain",
