  "title": "Data Poisoning Vulnerabilities Across Healthcare AI Architectures: A Security Threat Analysis",
  "published": "2025-11-14T07:16:16Z",
  "summary": "Healthcare AI systems face major vulnerabilities to data poisoning that current defenses and regulations cannot adequately address. We analyzed eight attack scenarios in four categories: architectural attacks on convolutional neural networks, large language models, and reinforcement learning agents; infrastructure attacks exploiting federated learning and medical documentation systems; critical resource allocation attacks affecting organ transplantation and crisis triage; and supply chain attack",
