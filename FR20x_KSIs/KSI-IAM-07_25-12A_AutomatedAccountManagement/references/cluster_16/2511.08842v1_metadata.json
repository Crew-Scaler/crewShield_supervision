  "title": "3D Guard-Layer: An Integrated Agentic AI Safety System for Edge Artificial Intelligence",
  "published": "2025-11-11T23:55:09Z",
  "summary": "AI systems have found a wide range of real-world applications in recent years. The adoption of edge artificial intelligence, embedding AI directly into edge devices, is rapidly growing. Despite the implementation of guardrails and safety mechanisms, security vulnerabilities and challenges have become increasingly prevalent in this domain, posing a significant barrier to the practical deployment and safety of AI systems. This paper proposes an agentic AI safety architecture that leverages 3D to i",
