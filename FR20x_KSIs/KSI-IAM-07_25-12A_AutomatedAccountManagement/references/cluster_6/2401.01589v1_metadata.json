  "published": "2024-01-03T07:47:22Z",
  "summary": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that enables cloud computing and information technology (IT) services to be delivered at the network's edge. By shifting the load of cloud computing to individual local servers, MEC helps meet the requirements of ultralow latency, localized data processing, and extends the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) for end-users. However, the crosscutting nature of MEC and the multidisciplinary components necessary for its deployment have presen",
