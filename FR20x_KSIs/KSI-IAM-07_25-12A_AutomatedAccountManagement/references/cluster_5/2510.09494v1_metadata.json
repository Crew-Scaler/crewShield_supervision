  "published": "2025-10-10T15:54:58Z",
  "summary": "As cloud infrastructure evolves to support dynamic and distributed workflows, accelerated now by AI-driven processes, the outdated model of standing permissions has become a critical vulnerability. Based on the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Top Threats to Cloud Computing Deep Dive 2025 Report, our analysis details how standing permissions cause catastrophic cloud breaches. While current security tools are addressing network and API security, the challenge of securing granular data access remains",
