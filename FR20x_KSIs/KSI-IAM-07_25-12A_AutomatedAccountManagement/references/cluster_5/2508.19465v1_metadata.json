  "title": "Addressing Weak Authentication like RFID, NFC in EVs and EVCs using AI-powered Adaptive Authentication",
  "published": "2025-08-26T22:54:24Z",
  "summary": "The rapid expansion of the Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Electric Vehicle Charging Systems (EVCs) has introduced new cybersecurity challenges, specifically in authentication protocols that protect vehicles, users, and energy infrastructure. Although widely adopted for convenience, traditional authentication mechanisms like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) rely on static identifiers and weak encryption, making them highly vulnerable to attack vectors such as ",
