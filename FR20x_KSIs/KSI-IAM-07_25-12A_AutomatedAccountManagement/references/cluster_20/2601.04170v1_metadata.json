  "title": "Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions",
  "published": "2026-01-07T18:37:26Z",
  "summary": "Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, p",
