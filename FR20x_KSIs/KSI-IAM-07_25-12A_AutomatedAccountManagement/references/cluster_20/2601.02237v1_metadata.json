  "published": "2026-01-05T16:11:39Z",
  "summary": "Modern cyberattacks are increasingly complex, posing significant challenges to classical machine learning methods, particularly when labeled data is limited and feature interactions are highly non-linear. In this study we investigates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical learning to enhance feature representations for intrusion detection and explore possible quantum advantages in cybersecurity analytics. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, network traffic is transformed into structured feature vec",
