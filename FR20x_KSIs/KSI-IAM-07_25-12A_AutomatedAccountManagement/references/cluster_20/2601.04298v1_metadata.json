  "summary": "Digitized, networked healthcare promises earlier detection, precision therapeutics, and continuous care; yet, it also expands the surface for privacy loss and compliance risk. We argue for a shift from siloed, application-specific protections to privacy-by-design at scale, centered on decision-theoretic differential privacy (DP) across the full healthcare data lifecycle; network-aware privacy accounting for interdependence in people, sensors, and organizations; and compliance-as-code tooling tha",
