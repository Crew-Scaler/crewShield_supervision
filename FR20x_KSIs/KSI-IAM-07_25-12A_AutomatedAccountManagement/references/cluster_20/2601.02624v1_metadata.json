  "summary": "The growing complexity of modern system-on-chip (SoC) and IP designs is making security assurance difficult day by day. One of the fundamental steps in the pre-silicon security verification of a hardware design is the identification of security assets, as it substantially influences downstream security verification tasks, such as threat modeling, security property generation, and vulnerability detection. Traditionally, assets are determined manually by security experts, requiring significant tim",
