  "title": "AI-Powered Hybrid Intrusion Detection Framework for Cloud Security Using Novel Metaheuristic Optimization",
  "published": "2026-01-03T09:42:28Z",
  "summary": "Cybersecurity poses considerable problems to Cloud Computing (CC), especially regarding Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facing difficulties with skewed datasets and suboptimal classification model performance. This study presents the Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HyIDS), an innovative IDS that employs the Energy Valley Optimizer (EVO) for Feature Selection (FS). Additionally, it introduces a novel technique for enhancing the cybersecurity of cloud computing through the integration of ma",
