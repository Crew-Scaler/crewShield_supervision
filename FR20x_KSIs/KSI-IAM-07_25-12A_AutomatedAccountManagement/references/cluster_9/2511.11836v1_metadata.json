  "title": "Securing Generative AI in Healthcare: A Zero-Trust Architecture Powered by Confidential Computing on Google Cloud",
  "published": "2025-11-14T19:56:52Z",
  "summary": "The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in healthcare is impeded by significant security challenges unaddressed by traditional frameworks, precisely the data-in-use gap where sensitive patient data and proprietary AI models are exposed during active processing. To address this, the paper proposes the Confidential Zero-Trust Framework (CZF), a novel security paradigm that synergistically combines Zero-Trust Architecture for granular access control with the hardware-enforced ",
