  "published": "2025-10-19T14:33:20Z",
  "summary": "The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation models either sacrifice accuracy for computational effi",
