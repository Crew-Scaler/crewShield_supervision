  "title": "An Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture for Threat Behavior Analysis via Deep Learning",
  "published": "2025-12-08T18:55:26Z",
  "summary": "The escalating sophistication and variety of cyber threats have rendered static honeypots inadequate, necessitating adaptive, intelligence-driven deception. In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform.",
