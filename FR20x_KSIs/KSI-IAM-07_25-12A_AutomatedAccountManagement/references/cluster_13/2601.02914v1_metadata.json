  "title": "Vulnerabilities of Audio-Based Biometric Authentication Systems Against Deepfake Speech Synthesis",
  "published": "2026-01-06T10:55:32Z",
  "summary": "As audio deepfakes transition from research artifacts to widely available commercial tools, robust biometric authentication faces pressing security threats in high-stakes industries. This paper presents a systematic empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art speaker authentication systems based on a large-scale speech synthesis dataset, revealing two major security vulnerabilities: 1) modern voice cloning models trained on very small samples can easily bypass commercial speaker verification system",
