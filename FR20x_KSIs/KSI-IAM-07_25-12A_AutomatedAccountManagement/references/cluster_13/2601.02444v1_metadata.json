  "title": "VocalBridge: Latent Diffusion-Bridge Purification for Defeating Perturbation-Based Voiceprint Defenses",
  "published": "2026-01-05T13:43:30Z",
  "summary": "The rapid advancement of speech synthesis technologies, including text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), has intensified security and privacy concerns related to voice cloning. Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and re",
