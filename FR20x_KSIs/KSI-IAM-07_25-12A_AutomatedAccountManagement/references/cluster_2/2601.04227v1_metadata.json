  "title": "Defense Against Synthetic Speech: Real-Time Detection of RVC Voice Conversion Attacks",
  "published": "2025-12-31T02:06:42Z",
  "summary": "Generative audio technologies now enable highly realistic voice cloning and real-time voice conversion, increasing the risk of impersonation, fraud, and misinformation in communication channels such as phone and video calls. This study investigates real-time detection of AI-generated speech produced using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC), evaluated on the DEEP-VOICE dataset, which includes authentic and voice-converted speech samples from multiple well-known speakers. To simulate realistic",
