  "summary": "Sybil attacks remain a fundamental obstacle in open online systems, where adversaries can cheaply create and sustain large numbers of fake identities. Existing defenses, including CAPTCHAs and one-time proof-of-personhood mechanisms, primarily address identity creation and provide limited protection against long-term, large-scale Sybil participation, especially as automated solvers and AI systems continue to improve.\n  We introduce the Human Challenge Oracle (HCO), a new security primitive for c",
