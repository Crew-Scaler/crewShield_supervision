  "summary": "The emergence of large-scale quantum computing threatens widely deployed public-key cryptographic systems, creating an urgent need for enterprise-level methods to assess post-quantum (PQ) readiness. While PQ standards are under development, organizations lack scalable and quantitative frameworks for measuring cryptographic exposure and prioritizing migration across complex infrastructures. This paper presents a knowledge graph based framework that models enterprise cryptographic assets, dependen",
