  "title": "Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network",
  "published": "2025-12-17T06:01:16Z",
  "summary": "The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, softwar",
