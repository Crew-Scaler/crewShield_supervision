  "summary": "Software obfuscation techniques make code more difficult\n  to understand, without changing its functionality. Such techniques\n  are often used by authors of malicious software to avoid\n  detection. Reverse Engineering\n  of obfuscated code, i.e., the process of overcoming obfuscation and\n  answering questions about the functionality of the code, is\n  notoriously difficult; and while various tools and methods exist for\n  this purpose, the process remains complex and slow, especially when\n  dealing",
