  "title": "From Consensus to Chaos: A Vulnerability Assessment of the RAFT Algorithm",
  "published": "2026-01-01T09:25:53Z",
  "summary": "In recent decades, the RAFT distributed consensus algorithm has become a main pillar of the distributed systems ecosystem, ensuring data consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. Although the fact that RAFT is well known for its simplicity, reliability, and efficiency, its security properties are not fully recognized, leaving implementations vulnerable to different kinds of attacks and threats, which can transform the RAFT harmony of consensus into a chaos of data inconsistency.
