  "published": "2025-12-26T02:04:24Z",
  "summary": "The Internet of Drones (IoD) is an emerging and crucial paradigm enabling advanced applications that require seamless, secure communication across heterogeneous and untrusted domains. In such environments, access control and the transmission of sensitive data pose significant security challenges for IoD systems, necessitating the design of lightweight mutual authentication and key exchange protocols. Existing solutions are often hampered by high computation overhead, reliance on third parties, t",
