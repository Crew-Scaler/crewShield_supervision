  "published": "2025-12-29T13:31:24Z",
  "summary": "In recent years, drone delivery, which utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for package delivery and pickup, has gradually emerged as a crucial method in logistics. Since delivery drones are expensive and may carry valuable packages, they must maintain a safe distance from individuals until user-drone mutual authentication is confirmed. Despite numerous authentication schemes being developed, existing solutions are limited in authentication distance and lack resilience against sophisticated ",
