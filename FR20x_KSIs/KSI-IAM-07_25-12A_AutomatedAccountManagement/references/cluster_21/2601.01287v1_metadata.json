  "published": "2026-01-03T21:14:40Z",
  "summary": "Trust and Reputation Management Systems (TRMSs) are critical for the modern web, yet their reliance on subjective user ratings or narrow Quality of Service (QoS) metrics lacks objective grounding. Concurrently, while regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA provide objective behavioral standards, automated compliance auditing has been limited to coarse, binary (pass/fail) outcomes. This paper bridges this research gap by operationalizing regulatory compliance as a quantitative and dynamic trust",
