  "summary": "Previous work on home router security has shown that using system calls to train a transformer-based language model built on a BERT-style encoder using contrastive learning is effective in detecting several types of malware, but the performance remains limited at low false positive rates. In this work, we demonstrate that using a high-fidelity eBPF-based system call sensor, together with contrastive augmented learning (which introduces controlled mutations of negative samples), improves detectio",
