  "published": "2026-01-08T06:33:15Z",
  "summary": "The deployment of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection systems necessitates processing sensitive user data, creating a fundamental conflict between authorship verification and privacy preservation. Standard anonymization techniques often disrupt linguistic fluency, while rigorous Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms typically degrade the statistical signals required for accurate detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{DP-MGTD}, a framework incorporating an Adaptive Differentiall",
