  "title": "Knowledge-to-Data: LLM-Driven Synthesis of Structured Network Traffic for Testbed-Free IDS Evaluation",
  "published": "2026-01-08T15:31:33Z",
  "summary": "Realistic, large-scale, and well-labeled cybersecurity datasets are essential for training and evaluating Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). However, they remain difficult to obtain due to privacy constraints, data sensitivity, and the cost of building controlled collection environments such as testbeds and cyber ranges. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can operate as controlled knowledge-to-data engines for generating structured synthetic network traffic datasets sui",
