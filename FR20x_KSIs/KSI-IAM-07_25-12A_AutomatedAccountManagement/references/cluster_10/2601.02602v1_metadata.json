  "published": "2026-01-05T23:35:39Z",
  "summary": "We present SWaRL, a robust and fidelity-preserving watermarking framework designed to protect the intellectual property of code LLM owners by embedding unique and verifiable signatures in the generated output. Existing approaches rely on manually crafted transformation rules to preserve watermarked code functionality or manipulate token-generation probabilities at inference time, which are prone to compilation errors. To address these challenges, SWaRL employs a reinforcement learning-based co-t",
