  "published": "2026-01-01T15:24:21Z",
  "summary": "Being able to understand the security and privacy (S&P) concerns of IoT users brings benefits to both developers and users. To learn about users' views, we examine Amazon IoT reviews - one of the biggest IoT markets. This work presents a state-of-the-art methodology to identify and categorize reviews in which users express S&P concerns. We developed an automated pipeline by fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo to build two models: the Classifier-Rationalizer-Categorizer and the Thematic Mapper. By leveragi",
