  "published": "2026-01-01T09:27:24Z",
  "summary": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a key technique for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in knowledge-intensive applications. As these KGs often represent an organization's highly valuable intellectual property (IP), they face a significant risk of theft for private use. In this scenario, attackers operate in isolated environments. This private-use threat renders passive defenses like watermarking ineffective, as they requi",
