  "summary": "Encrypted network traffic poses significant challenges for intrusion detection due to the lack of payload visibility, limited labeled datasets, and high class imbalance between benign and malicious activities. Traditional data augmentation methods struggle to preserve the complex temporal and statistical characteristics of real network traffic. To address these issues, this work explores the use of Generative AI (GAI) models to synthesize realistic and diverse encrypted traffic traces. We evalua",
