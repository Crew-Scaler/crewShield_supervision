  "published": "2025-11-03T20:39:25Z",
  "summary": "The modern AI data economy centralizes power, limits innovation, and misallocates value by extracting data without control, privacy, or fair compensation. We introduce Private Map-Secure Reduce (PMSR), a network-native paradigm that transforms data economics from extractive to participatory through cryptographically enforced markets. Extending MapReduce to decentralized settings, PMSR enables computation to move to the data, ensuring verifiable privacy, efficient price discovery, and incentive a",
