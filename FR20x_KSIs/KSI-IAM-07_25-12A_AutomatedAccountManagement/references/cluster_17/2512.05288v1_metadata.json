  "published": "2025-12-04T22:26:30Z",
  "summary": "Malicious WebShells pose a significant and evolving threat by compromising critical digital infrastructures and endangering public services in sectors such as healthcare and finance. While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classifica",
