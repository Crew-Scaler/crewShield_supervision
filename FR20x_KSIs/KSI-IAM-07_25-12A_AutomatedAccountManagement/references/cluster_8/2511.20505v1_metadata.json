  "summary": "Cryptographic identity anchors modern decentralized systems, yet current standards like BIP-39 and BIP-32 are structurally insufficient for the demands of multi-curve, multi-domain, and post-quantum (PQC) environments. These legacy schemes rely on a monolithic identity root with no inherent context isolation, algorithm agility, or secure secret rotation. This paper introduces MSCIKDF, a single-root, multi-curve, context-isolated, PQC-pluggable cryptographic identity primitive. MSCIKDF defines a ",
