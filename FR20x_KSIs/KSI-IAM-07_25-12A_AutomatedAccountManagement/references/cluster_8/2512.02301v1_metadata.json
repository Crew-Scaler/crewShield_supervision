  "title": "Quantum Vanguard: Server Optimized Privacy Fortified Federated Intelligence for Future Vehicles",
  "published": "2025-12-02T00:43:48Z",
  "summary": "This work presents vQFL (vehicular Quantum Federated Learning), a new framework that leverages quantum machine learning techniques to tackle key privacy and security issues in autonomous vehicular networks. Furthermore, we propose a server-side adapted fine-tuning method, ft-VQFL,to achieve enhanced and more resilient performance. By integrating quantum federated learning with differential privacy and quantum key distribution (QKD), our quantum vanguard approach creates a multi-layered defense a",
