      "summary": "Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to ...",

Accurately predicting the effectiveness of this feedback, specifically whether it leads to a change in trainee behavior, is crucial for developing methods for improving surgical training and education.

However, existing methods typically require multiple training samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking motions.

We pre-train a large teacher KG embedding model over linked multi-source KGs and distill knowledge to train a student model for a task-specific KG. To enable knowledge transfer across different KGs, we use entity alignment to build a linked subgraph for connecting the pre-trained KGs and the target KG. The linked...",

Traditionally, human resource experts and industrial-organizational psychologists have developed systematic hiring methods, including job advertising, candidate skill assessments, and structured interviews to ensure candidate-organization fit. Recently, recruitment practices have shifted dramatically toward artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, driven by the need to efficiently manage large applicant pools. However, reliance on AI raises concerns about the amplification and propagation...",

The use of strong pre-trained models (PTMs) can greatly facilitate knowledge transfer and alleviate catastrophic forgetting, but also suffers from progressive overfitting of pre-trained knowledge into specific downstream tasks. A majority of current efforts often keep the PTMs frozen and incorporate task-specific prompts to instruct representation learning, coupled with a prompt selection process for inference. However, due to the limited cap...",

With advancements in surgical training programs in both physical and virtual environments, it is imperative to develop generalizable methods for automatically assessing skills.

Our approach leverages labeled data from common surgical training tasks such as Suturing, Needle Passing, and Knot Tying to jointly train a model with both labeled a...",

An explicit formula for the average rate of return of a group of investment/pension funds in a discrete time stochastic model is derived and several properties of this index are shown. In particular, it is proven to be martingale-fair, i.e. be a martingale provided the prices of assets on the financial market form a vector martingale. The problem of merger of the funds is treated in detail.",

Accurately predicting the effectiveness of this feedback, specifically whether it leads to a change in trainee behavior, is crucial for developing methods for improving surgical training and education. However, relying on human annotations to assess feedback effectiveness is laborious and prone to biases, underscoring the need for an automated, scalable, and objective method. Creating such an automated system poses challenges, as it requires an un...",

However, literature review revealed that in most publications and analyst firms reports, this issue is just overlooked.
