# Processing Summary (Removed from Questions)

## Processing Summary

### Questions Removed (8 total):
1. Generic compliance documentation questions that don't address AI-specific training effectiveness
2. Duplicate questions across different stakeholder perspectives with identical intent
3. Questions better suited for other KSIs (general training vs. IR/DR specific)
4. Overly granular administrative questions that don't assess training effectiveness
5. Questions on training delivery infrastructure rather than content effectiveness
6. Generic audit readiness questions without AI context
7. Redundant escalation communication questions
8. Generic documentation questions

### Questions Added (7 total):
1. AI model poisoning incident response training procedures
2. Prompt injection attack incident detection and response training
3. AI supply chain compromise incident procedures
4. Training on catastrophic forgetting risks during emergency model retraining
5. Multi-agent cascade failure scenario training
6. AI cognitive drift detection and response procedures
7. Autonomous recovery validation training for AI systems

### Rationale:
The curation focused on maintaining questions directly relevant to AI/AI agent incident response and disaster recovery training effectiveness. Questions were removed if they addressed general administrative processes, duplicated other questions, or lacked AI-specific context. New questions were added to address emerging AI threat vectors and operational challenges identified in the KSI-CED-04 report, particularly around AI agent autonomy, model poisoning, and stateful recovery complexity.
