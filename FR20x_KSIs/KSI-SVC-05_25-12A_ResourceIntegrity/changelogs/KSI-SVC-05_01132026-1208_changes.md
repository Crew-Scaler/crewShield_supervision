**Total Questions:** 38 (8 sections: 5+5+5+5+5+5+3+5 questions)

**Refinement Summary (Issue #46):**
- Tightened Q02, Q06-Q08, Q11-Q12, Q14, Q20, Q23-Q25, Q31, Q35 to explicitly emphasize cryptographic integrity validation and signed artifact verification
- Reframed Q31 and Q35 to connect runtime monitoring to cryptographic baselines and signed change authorization
- Reframed Q33 to focus on signed change manifests and cryptographic authorization enforcement
- Moved Q32 (concept drift in monitoring models) to KSI-CMT-01/CNA-08 (runtime monitoring focus)
- Moved Q34 (federated anomaly detection poisoning) to KSI-CMT-01/CNA-08 (distributed monitoring focus)
- Narrowed SVC-05 scope to focus exclusively on cryptographic validation mechanisms

**Ready for:** Security architecture teams, compliance auditors, CSP infrastructure evaluation, AI model governance, cryptographic verification system design
