RESEARCH GAPS IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

HIGH PRIORITY (Expected in Agent 2-3):
1. Multi-cloud IaC security orchestration
2. Kubernetes/container orchestration security
3. Supply chain security for IaC artifacts
4. Adversarial robustness of IaC ML models
5. Explainability of ML-based IaC decisions

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
6. Real-time vulnerability scanning at scale
7. Cross-framework policy harmonization
8. ML model drift detection for IaC tools
9. Regulatory framework expansion beyond major standards
10. Integration with CI/CD pipeline security

EMERGING AREAS:
- Foundation models for infrastructure understanding
- Large language models for compliance interpretation
- Vision transformers for code analysis
- Autonomous infrastructure self-management

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSOLIDATION
================================================================================

FOR AGENT 2 (QUERIES 5-12):
- Focus on multi-cloud orchestration (identified gap)
- Investigate container/Kubernetes security (minimal coverage)
- Research supply chain security for IaC modules
- Explore adversarial robustness and explainability

EXPECTED OVERLAP AREAS:
- Compliance automation (may appear in Agent 2)
- Policy generation (may be refined by Agent 2)
- Risk assessment methods (could be complemented)

RECOMMENDED CONSOLIDATION APPROACH:
1. Merge overlapping papers into single research collection
2. Use relevance scoring to identify highest-quality papers across agents
3. Map research by technology (LSTM, GNN, Transformers, etc.)
4. Create technology-focused synthesis documents
5. Identify gaps remaining after all agents complete
