## Document Metadata

**Version:** 2.1 (Task 2 Fine-Tuning Applied)
**Generated:** 2026-01-08
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-13
**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets with Task 1 filtering and Task 2 refinement

**Total Questions:** 34 (down from 38 pre-refinement, 45 original)
**Sections:** 10 (organized by functional area)

**Changes Made (Task 2 Fine-Tuning):**
- Removed Q37-Q38 (ML Supply Chain questions belonging to KSI-CNA-08)
- Merged original Q23 (security-focused testing) into Q003 (detection capabilities)
- Merged original Q34 + Q35 (compliance mapping + report generation) into Q033 (unified compliance reporting)
- Renumbered all questions to standard format: KSI-MLA-05-Q001 through KSI-MLA-05-Q034
- Reorganized into 10 functional sections with clear section headers
- Tightened focus on "Evaluate Configuration" core mission
- Enhanced clarity on AI agent role in evaluation, testing, and remediation

**Questions Merged:** 2 consolidations (Q003 merged Q023; Q033 merged Q034+Q035)
**Final Question Count:** 34 (down from 36 post-Task-1)
**Filtering Criteria:** Questions directly addressing configuration evaluation, testing, compliance validation, and drift detection/remediation for infrastructure-as-code; eliminated redundancy; organized by evaluation workflow phases.

**Research Basis:** 67 peer-reviewed papers synthesized across 8 clusters including:
- AI-based IaC vulnerability detection (80-90% accuracy achieved)
- Configuration drift detection and autonomous remediation (85%+ success with safety frameworks)
- Policy-as-code generation and regulatory compliance automation
- Secrets detection (>95% LLM-based vs. 40-50% regex-based)
- Multi-cloud infrastructure governance and supply chain security
- Compliance automation reducing audit overhead by 60-70%
