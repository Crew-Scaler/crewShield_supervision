**Abstract:**
Modern intrusion detection systems (IDS) leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to detect malicious activity in system provenance data, but their decisions often remain a black box to analysts. This paper presents a comprehensive XAI framework designed to bridge the trust gap in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) by making graph-based detection transparent. We implement this framework on top of KAIROS, a state-of-the-art temporal graph-based IDS, though our design is applicable to any temporal gr...

**Relevance Assessment:**
**HIGHLY RELEVANT** - Directly addresses SOC analyst trust, intrusion detection systems, and explainability in security operations. This paper is a key contribution to understanding how to reduce analyst fatigue through better system transparency.

**Abstract:**
Threat detection models in cybersecurity must keep up with shifting traffic, strict feature budgets, and noisy hardware, yet even strong classical systems still miss rare or borderline attacks when the data distribution drifts. Small, near-term quantum processors are now available, but existing work rarely shows whether quantum components can improve end-to-end detection under these unstable, resource constrained conditions rather than just adding complexity. We address this gap with a hybrid ar...

**Relevance Assessment:**
**RELEVANT** - Addresses threat detection, security automation, or related cybersecurity topics with AI/ML components. Provides valuable insights into detection systems and their operational challenges.

**Abstract:**
Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) refer to systems capable of perceiving their states and moving without human intervention. Among the factors required for autonomous decision-making in mobility, positional awareness of the vehicle itself is the most critical. Accordingly, extensive research has been conducted on defense mechanisms against GPS spoofing attacks, which threaten AVs by disrupting position recognition. Among these, detection methods based on internal IMU sensors are regarded as some of the ...

**Abstract:**
Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs r...

The Power over Fiber (PoF) technology delivers electrical power by transmitting laser light through a lightweight, non-conductive fiber optic cable to a remote photovoltaic optical converter, which in turn powers sensors or electrical devices. Among the several advantages offered by this solution are spark-free operation in the presence of electric fields, elimination of noise induced by power lines, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and high robustness in hostile environments. The R\&D ...

Another threat is the development of large quantum computers, which have a high likelihood of breaking the high popular security protocols because it can use both Shor and Grover algorithms. In order to fix this looming threat, quantum-resistant cryptographic systems, otherwise known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), are being formulated to protect cybersecurity systems of the future. The current paper presents the state of the art in designing, realizing, and testing the security of robust qu...

FinTechs increasing connectivity, rapid innovation, and reliance on global digital infrastructures present significant cybersecurity challenges. Traditional cybersecurity frameworks often struggle to identify and prioritize sector-specific vulnerabilities or adapt to evolving adversary tactics, particularly in highly targeted sectors such as FinTech. To address these gaps, we propose ISADM (Integrated STRIDE-ATTACK-D3FEND Threat Model), a novel hybrid methodology applied to FinTech security that...

**Abstract:**
Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored.
