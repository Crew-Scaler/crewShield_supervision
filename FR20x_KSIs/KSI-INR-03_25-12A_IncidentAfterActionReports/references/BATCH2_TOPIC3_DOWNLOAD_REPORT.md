**Authors:**  
- Gauri Kholkar
- Ratinder Ahuja

**Abstract:**  
As autonomous AI agents are used in regulated and safety-critical settings, organizations need effective ways to turn policy into enforceable controls. We introduce a regulatory machine learning framework that converts unstructured design artifacts (like PRDs, TDDs, and code) into verifiable runtime guardrails. Our Policy as Prompt method reads these documents and risk controls to build a source-linked policy tree. This tree is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers for real-ti

### Paper 2: Policy Cards: Machine-Readable Runtime Governance for Autonomous AI Agents

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.24383v1  
**Publication Date:** 2025-10-28 (2025)  
**Page Count:** 21  
**Relevance Score:** 9/11  
**Filename:** `2510.24383_v1_Policy_Cards_Machine_Readable_Runtime_Governance_for_Autonom.pdf`

**Authors:**  
- Juraj Mavračić

**Abstract:**  
Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents. The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by defining a normative layer that encodes allow/de

### Paper 5: Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14956v1  
**Publication Date:** 2025-09-18 (2025)  
**Page Count:** 25  
**Relevance Score:** 9/11

This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potentia

### Paper 6: Standardized Threat Taxonomy for AI Security, Governance, and Regulatory Compliance

**ArXiv ID:** 2511.21901v1  
**Publication Date:** 2025-11-26 (2025)  
**Page Count:** 10  
**Relevance Score:** 7/11  
**Filename:** `2511.21901_v1_Standardized_Threat_Taxonomy_for_AI_Security_Governance_and.pdf`

**Authors:**  
- Hernan Huwyler

**Abstract:**  
The accelerating deployment of artificial intelligence systems across regulated sectors has exposed critical fragmentation in risk assessment methodologies. A significant "language barrier" currently separates technical security teams, who focus on algorithmic vulnerabilities (e.g., MITRE ATLAS), from legal and compliance professionals, who address regulatory mandates (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into

### Paper 7: AudAgent: Automated Auditing of Privacy Policy Compliance in AI Agents

**ArXiv ID:** 2511.07441v3  
**Publication Date:** 2025-11-03 (2025)  
**Page Count:** 19  
**Relevance Score:** 7/11  
**Filename:** `2511.07441_v3_AudAgent_Automated_Auditing_of_Privacy_Policy_Compliance_in.pdf`

**Authors:**  
- Ye Zheng
- Yidan Hu

**Abstract:**  
AI agents can autonomously perform tasks and, often without explicit user consent, collect or disclose users' sensitive local data, which raises serious privacy concerns. Although AI agents' privacy policies describe their intended data practices, there remains limited transparency and accountability about whether runtime behavior matches those policies. To close this gap, we introduce AudAgent, a visual tool that continuously monitors AI agents' data practices in real time and guards compliance

**Abstract:**  
Organizations and governments that develop, deploy, use, and govern AI must coordinate on effective risk mitigation. However, the landscape of AI risk mitigation frameworks is fragmented, uses inconsistent terminology, and has gaps in coverage. This paper introduces a preliminary AI Risk Mitigation Taxonomy to organize AI risk mitigations and provide a common frame of reference. The Taxonomy was developed through a rapid evidence scan of 13 AI risk mitigation frameworks published between 2023-20
