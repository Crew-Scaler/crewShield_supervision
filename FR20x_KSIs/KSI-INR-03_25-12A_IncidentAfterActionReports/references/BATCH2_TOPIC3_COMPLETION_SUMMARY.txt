================================================================================
IDENTIFIED GAPS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
================================================================================

1. Limited FedRAMP-specific frameworks
   → Most papers address general AI governance

2. Federal cloud integration
   → Few papers specifically address CSP environments

3. Multi-tenant scenarios
   → Limited coverage of shared responsibility models

4. Long-term monitoring
   → Focus on real-time rather than historical analysis

Recommended Additional Research:
- FedRAMP-specific AI governance frameworks
- Cloud-native continuous monitoring for AI systems
- Multi-tenant AI governance in federal environments
- Historical incident pattern analysis for AI systems

================================================================================
CONCLUSION

The research provides a strong foundation for implementing lessons learned
integration, parameter capture, cross-system knowledge distribution, and
continuous monitoring in FedRAMP-compliant AI systems.

Key innovations identified:
1. Machine-readable governance (Policy Cards, Policy-as-Prompt)
2. Automated compliance verification (AudAgent, Financial Audit)
3. Real-time monitoring (Sentinel Agents, SMART+)
4. Standardized taxonomies (Threat Taxonomy, Risk Mitigation)
5. NIST framework alignment (AAGATE)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Detailed review of each paper for implementation specifics
2. Cross-reference with existing FedRAMP requirements
3. Develop integration roadmap for selected frameworks
4. Identify pilot programs for framework validation
