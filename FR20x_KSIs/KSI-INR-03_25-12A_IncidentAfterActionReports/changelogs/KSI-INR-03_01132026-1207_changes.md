**Data Source:** Synthesized from 39 research papers on AI-driven incident after-action reports, lessons learned, and operational resilience (2024-2025)
**Filtering Criteria (Issue #33):** Removed out-of-scope questions on model ops, IAM/privilege, and human factors training. Kept core INR-03 themes: post-incident governance, MTTR/acceleration, AI-specific failure modes (drift, hallucinations, cascades) and governance impact, FedRAMP compliance, lessons learned integration. Consolidated overlapping questions and trimmed excessive detail.

**Research Synthesis (Refined):** Incident Response Acceleration (10 papers) achieving 30.13% MTTR reduction but creating governance accountability gaps; Model Drift & Silent Degradation (11 papers, condensed focus on governance impact) with 91% of ML systems degrading; AI Hallucinations & Traceability (10 papers) generating 50%+ false positives affecting organizational learning; Lessons Learned Integration (10 papers) requiring governance structures mapping to NIST 800-53 and FedRAMP; Cascade Failures & Feedback Loops (10 papers) amplifying errors 10-100x; Automated Cloud Remediation (10 papers) causing unintended consequences without governance oversight. Key findings: 30.13% MTTR improvement from AI but organizational governance insufficient for autonomous incident response, 50%+ false positives contaminating lessons learned, 10-100x error amplification through cascades, governance gap between reactive human-centered IR and autonomous millisecond-speed decisions.
