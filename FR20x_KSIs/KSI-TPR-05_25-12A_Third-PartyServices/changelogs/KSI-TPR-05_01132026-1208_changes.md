# Extracted Metadata and Statistics

Extracted on: 01132026-1208

**Processing Date**: January 13, 2026 (Human Review Refinement per Issue #68)

**Original Question Count**: 40 questions (36 core + 4 migrated from other KSIs)

**Questions Removed**: 3 questions
- Original Q005 (Behavioral Baseline Construction) - moved to CMT-01 (observability focus, not third-party risk core)
- Original Q016 (Behavioral Anomaly Detection) - moved to CMT-01 (distributed tracing/observability, not third-party supply chain focus)
- Original Q012 (Cost Management and Billing Transparency) - trimmed (pure billing optimization without security/risk framing, better fit for governance KSI)

**Questions Consolidated**: 4 consolidations
- Service discovery + API version management → KSI-TPR-05-Q001 (combined service/API evolution)
- Ephemeral credentials + mid-workflow expiration → KSI-TPR-05-Q002 (consolidated credential resilience)
- Supply chain monitoring + behavioral baselines → KSI-TPR-05-Q003 (unified supply chain detection)
- Distributed tracing forensics partially consolidated with incident response (Q006)

**Perspective Neutralization**:
- Removed stakeholder role distinctions (CIO/Customer/Auditor)
- Made all questions generic, organization-focused
- Updated IDs to format: KSI-TPR-05-Q{number}

**Final Question Count**: 23 core discovery questions (focused on third-party service risk, supply chain, credentials, and incident response)

**Questions Moved to Other KSIs** (Not in this file):
- CMT-01-Q50: Behavioral baselines for third-party API access patterns (monitoring/observability focus)
- CMT-01-Q51: Distributed tracing for agent-service interactions (observability/tracing focus)
- Q-AIM-04-NEW-01: Cost management and billing transparency for agent-driven API usage → KSI-AIM-04 (Governance/Cost)

**Questions Retained from Previous Migrations**:
- KSI-TPR-05-Q019 (Ransomware 3.0 & Multi-Agent Security - from KSI-RPL-03)
- KSI-TPR-05-Q020 (Data Residency & Cross-Border Sovereignty - from KSI-RPL-03)

## Executive Overview

This document contains discovery questions to guide comprehensive assessment of third-party service integration security in autonomous AI agent environments. These questions address the four critical findings from the KSI-TPR-05 research:

1. Autonomous API integration architecture requiring fundamental changes
2. Credential management paradigm shifts for non-human identities
3. Supply chain risk expansion including data poisoning and dependency chains
4. Machine-speed incident response requirements

Questions are organized by discovery theme rather than stakeholder role, enabling flexible application across organizational contexts.
