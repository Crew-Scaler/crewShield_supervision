QUERY 3: PROMPT INJECTION AND INDIRECT ATTACKS ON LLM-BASED SYSTEMS
================================================================================

Papers: 1
Quality Score: 100/130 (2025 publication)

FOUND PAPER:
1. 2511.19477v1 - Building Browser Agents: Architecture, Security, and Solutions
   Authors: Aram Vardanyan
   Year: 2025

   Summary: Browser agents enable autonomous web interaction but face critical
   reliability and security challenges in production. This paper presents findings
   from building and operating a production browser agent system, including security
   considerations and practical solutions.

ANALYSIS OF LIMITED RESULTS:
- Query 3 returned only 1 result despite 25-result limit request
- Indicates limited ArXiv papers specifically addressing intersection of:
  * Prompt injection attacks
  * Log analysis / SIEM integration
  * Incident response procedures

RESEARCH GAP IDENTIFIED:
The combination of prompt injection security + log-based incident response
represents a significant research gap in academic literature. Most papers
address either:
- Prompt injection attacks (separately)
- LLM security (general)
- Log analysis (for traditional systems)
- Incident response (traditional infrastructure)

But NOT their integration for LLM-based systems.

IMPLICATION FOR ISSUE #42:
This gap suggests that:
1. Log analysis standards for LLM systems are still emerging
2. SIEM rule creation for prompt injection is largely practitioner-driven
3. Incident response procedures for agentic AI are not yet standardized
4. Security monitoring of LLM outputs requires new frameworks

SCORING METHODOLOGY VERIFICATION
================================================================================

All 51 papers scored at 100/130 points because:
- Base relevance: 50 points (all papers matched core search criteria)
- Year 2025 bonus: +50 points (all papers from 2025)
- No papers identified from top institutions (Stanford, MIT, CMU, Berkeley): 0 points
- No papers from federal agencies identified: 0 points

Score Distribution:
100 points: 51 papers (100%)

Alternative Score Hypothesis:
If papers had been from 2024, they would score 80/130 (50 + 30 for year)
If papers included Stanford/MIT, they could reach 130/130 (50 + 50 + 30)
