2512.14600|Yihan Liao, Jacky Keung, Xiaoxue Ma, Jingyu Zhang, Yicheng Sun|PerProb: Indirectly Evaluating Memorization in Large Language Models|2025|100|The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by extensive datasets that may contain sensitive information, raising serious privacy concerns. One notable threat is the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), where adversaries infer whether a specific sample was used in model training. However, the true impact of MIA on LLMs remains unclear due to inconsistent findings and the lack of standardized evaluation methods, further complicated by the undisclosed nature of many LLM training sets. To address these limitations, we propose PerProb, a unified, label-free framework for indirectly assessing LLM memorization vulnerabilities. PerProb evaluates changes in perplexity and average log probability between data generated by victim and adversary models, enabling an indirect estimation of training-induced memory. Compared with prior MIA methods that rely on member/non-member labels or internal access, PerProb is independent of model and task, and applicable in both black-box and white-box settings. Through a systematic classification of MIA into four attack patterns, we evaluate PerProb's effectiveness across five datasets, revealing varying memory behaviors and privacy risks among LLMs. Additionally, we assess mitigation strategies, including knowledge distillation, early stopping, and differential privacy, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing data leakage. Our findings offer a practical and generalizable framework for evaluating and improving LLM privacy.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14600|True
2512.13352|Ali Al Sahili, Ali Chehab, Razane Tajeddine|On the Effectiveness of Membership Inference in Targeted Data Extraction from Large Language Models|2025|100|Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to memorizing training data, which poses serious privacy risks. Two of the most prominent concerns are training data extraction and Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Prior research has shown that these threats are interconnected: adversaries can extract training data from an LLM by querying the model to generate a large volume of text and subsequently applying MIAs to verify whether a particular data point was included in the training set. In this study, we integrate multiple MIA techniques into the data extraction pipeline to systematically benchmark their effectiveness. We then compare their performance in this integrated setting against results from conventional MIA benchmarks, allowing us to evaluate their practical utility in real-world extraction scenarios.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13352|True
2512.12002|Jie Ma, Junqing Zhang, Guanxiong Shen, Alan Marshall, Chip-Hong Chang|Adversarial Attacks Against Deep Learning-Based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification|2025|100|Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is an emerging technique for the lightweight authentication of wireless Internet of things (IoT) devices. RFFI exploits deep learning models to extract hardware impairments to uniquely identify wireless devices. Recent studies show deep learning-based RFFI is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, effective adversarial attacks against different types of RFFI classifiers have not yet been explored. In this paper, we carried out a comprehensive investigations into different adversarial attack methods on RFFI systems using various deep learning models. Three specific algorithms, fast gradient sign method (FGSM), projected gradient descent (PGD), and universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), were analyzed. The attacks were launched to LoRa-RFFI and the experimental results showed the generated perturbations were effective against convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRU). We further used UAP to launch practical attacks. Special factors were considered for the wireless context, including implementing real-time attacks, the effectiveness of the attacks over a period of time, etc. Our experimental evaluation demonstrated that UAP can successfully launch adversarial attacks against the RFFI, achieving a success rate of 81.7% when the adversary almost has no prior knowledge of the victim RFFI systems.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12002|True
2512.08809|Yi Liu, Weixiang Han, Chengjun Cai, Xingliang Yuan, Cong Wang|PrivTune: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Device-Cloud Collaboration|2025|100|With the rise of large language models, service providers offer language models as a service, enabling users to fine-tune customized models via uploaded private datasets. However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_χ$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08809|True
2512.03121|Ziyi Tong, Feifei Sun, Le Minh Nguyen|Lost in Modality: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Text-Based Membership Inference Attacks on Large Multimodal Models|2025|100|Large Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs) are emerging as one of the foundational tools in an expanding range of applications. Consequently, understanding training-data leakage in these systems is increasingly critical. Log-probability-based membership inference attacks (MIAs) have become a widely adopted approach for assessing data exposure in large language models (LLMs), yet their effect in MLLMs remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of extending these text-based MIA methods to multimodal settings. Our experiments under vision-and-text (V+T) and text-only (T-only) conditions across the DeepSeek-VL and InternVL model families show that in in-distribution settings, logit-based MIAs perform comparably across configurations, with a slight V+T advantage. Conversely, in out-of-distribution settings, visual inputs act as regularizers, effectively masking membership signals.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03121|True
2512.03100|Haowei Fu, Bo Ni, Han Xu, Kunpeng Liu, Dan Lin, Tyler Derr|Ensemble Privacy Defense for Knowledge-Intensive LLMs against Membership Inference Attacks|2025|100|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Finetuning (SFT) have become the predominant paradigms for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge for diverse, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, while such knowledge injection improves performance, it also exposes new attack surfaces. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a given data sample was included in a model's training set, pose serious threats to privacy and trust in sensitive domains. To this end, we first systematically evaluate the vulnerability of RAG- and SFT-based LLMs to various MIAs. Then, to address the privacy risk, we further introduce a novel, model-agnostic defense framework, Ensemble Privacy Defense (EPD), which aggregates and evaluates the outputs of a knowledge-injected LLM, a base LLM, and a dedicated judge model to enhance resistance against MIAs. Comprehensive experiments show that, on average, EPD reduces MIA success by up to 27.8\% for SFT and 526.3\% for RAG compared to inference-time baseline, while maintaining answer quality.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03100|True
2511.20710|David Amebley, Sayanton Dibbo|Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?|2025|100|In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710|True
2511.19536|Yixin Wu, Rui Wen, Chi Cui, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang|AttackPilot: Autonomous Inference Attacks Against ML Services With LLM-Based Agents|2025|100|Inference attacks have been widely studied and offer a systematic risk assessment of ML services; however, their implementation and the attack parameters for optimal estimation are challenging for non-experts. The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19536|True
2511.17989|Jiayi Luo, Qingyun Sun, Yuecen Wei, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Jianxin Li|Privacy Auditing of Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained Model under Membership Inference Attacks|2025|100|Multi-domain graph pre-training has emerged as a pivotal technique in developing graph foundation models. While it greatly improves the generalization of graph neural networks, its privacy risks under membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a specific instance was used in training (member), remain largely unexplored. However, effectively conducting MIAs against multi-domain graph pre-trained models is a significant challenge due to: (i) Enhanced Generalization Capability: Multi-domain pre-training reduces the overfitting characteristics commonly exploited by MIAs. (ii) Unrepresentative Shadow Datasets: Diverse training graphs hinder the obtaining of reliable shadow graphs. (iii) Weakened Membership Signals: Embedding-based outputs offer less informative cues than logits for MIAs. To tackle these challenges, we propose MGP-MIA, a novel framework for Membership Inference Attacks against Multi-domain Graph Pre-trained models. Specifically, we first propose a membership signal amplification mechanism that amplifies the overfitting characteristics of target models via machine unlearning. We then design an incremental shadow model construction mechanism that builds a reliable shadow model with limited shadow graphs via incremental learning. Finally, we introduce a similarity-based inference mechanism that identifies members based on their similarity to positive and negative samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MGP-MIA and reveal the privacy risks of multi-domain graph pre-training.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17989|True
2511.14045|Yule Liu, Heyi Zhang, Jinyi Zheng, Zhen Sun, Zifan Peng, Tianshuo Cong, Yilong Yang, Xinlei He, Zhuo Ma|GRPO Privacy Is at Risk: A Membership Inference Attack Against Reinforcement Learning With Verifiable Rewards|2025|100|Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.   To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14045|True
2511.13502|Yuyang Xia, Ruixuan Liu, Li Xiong|Tight and Practical Privacy Auditing for Differentially Private In-Context Learning|2025|100|Large language models (LLMs) perform in-context learning (ICL) by adapting to tasks from prompt demonstrations, which in practice often contain private or proprietary data. Although differential privacy (DP) with private voting is a pragmatic mitigation, DP-ICL implementations are error-prone, and worst-case DP bounds may substantially overestimate actual leakage, calling for practical auditing tools. We present a tight and efficient privacy auditing framework for DP-ICL systems that runs membership inference attacks and translates their success rates into empirical privacy guarantees using Gaussian DP. Our analysis of the private voting mechanism identifies vote configurations that maximize the auditing signal, guiding the design of audit queries that reliably reveal whether a canary demonstration is present in the context. The framework supports both black-box (API-only) and white-box (internal vote) threat models, and unifies auditing for classification and generation by reducing both to a binary decision problem. Experiments on standard text classification and generation benchmarks show that our empirical leakage estimates closely match theoretical DP budgets on classification tasks and are consistently lower on generation tasks due to conservative embedding-sensitivity bounds, making our framework a practical privacy auditor and verifier for real-world DP-ICL deployments.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13502|True
2511.12043|Hao Li, Jiajun He, Guangshuo Wang, Dengguo Feng, Zheng Li, Min Zhang|BudgetLeak: Membership Inference Attacks on RAG Systems via the Generation Budget Side Channel|2025|100|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by integrating external knowledge, but reliance on proprietary or sensitive corpora poses various data risks, including privacy leakage and unauthorized data usage. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are a common technique to assess such risks, yet existing approaches underperform in RAG due to black-box constraints and the absence of strong membership signals. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored side channel in RAG systems: the generation budget, which controls the maximum number of tokens allowed in a generated response. Varying this budget reveals observable behavioral patterns between member and non-member queries, as members gain quality more rapidly with larger budgets. Building on this insight, we propose BudgetLeak, a novel membership inference attack that probes responses under different budgets and analyzes metric evolution via sequence modeling or clustering. Extensive experiments across four datasets, three LLM generators, and two retrievers demonstrate that BudgetLeak consistently outperforms existing baselines, while maintaining high efficiency and practical viability. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked data risk in RAG systems and highlight the need for new defenses.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12043|True
2511.08905|Zixun Xiong, Gaoyi Wu, Qingyang Yu, Mingyu Derek Ma, Lingfeng Yao, Miao Pan, Xiaojiang Du, Hao Wang|iSeal: Encrypted Fingerprinting for Reliable LLM Ownership Verification|2025|100|Given the high cost of large language model (LLM) training from scratch, safeguarding LLM intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly crucial. As the standard paradigm for IP ownership verification, LLM fingerprinting thus plays a vital role in addressing this challenge. Existing LLM fingerprinting methods verify ownership by extracting or injecting model-specific features. However, they overlook potential attacks during the verification process, leaving them ineffective when the model thief fully controls the LLM's inference process. In such settings, attackers may share prompt-response pairs to enable fingerprint unlearning or manipulate outputs to evade exact-match verification. We propose iSeal, the first fingerprinting method designed for reliable verification when the model thief controls the suspected LLM in an end-to-end manner. It injects unique features into both the model and an external module, reinforced by an error-correction mechanism and a similarity-based verification strategy. These components are resistant to verification-time attacks, including collusion-based fingerprint unlearning and response manipulation, backed by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. iSeal achieves 100 percent Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) on 12 LLMs against more than 10 attacks, while baselines fail under unlearning and response manipulations.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08905|True
2511.07033|Yuanheng Li, Zhuoyang Chen, Xiaoyun Liu, Yuhao Wang, Mingwei Liu, Yang Shi, Kaifeng Huang, Shengjie Zhao|Uncovering Pretraining Code in LLMs: A Syntax-Aware Attribution Approach|2025|100|As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, concerns over the unauthorized use of copyrighted and licensed content in their training data have grown, especially in the context of code. Open-source code, often protected by open source licenses (e.g, GPL), poses legal and ethical challenges when used in pretraining. Detecting whether specific code samples were included in LLM training data is thus critical for transparency, accountability, and copyright compliance. We propose SynPrune, a syntax-pruned membership inference attack method tailored for code. Unlike prior MIA approaches that treat code as plain text, SynPrune leverages the structured and rule-governed nature of programming languages. Specifically, it identifies and excludes consequent tokens that are syntactically required and not reflective of authorship, from attribution when computing membership scores. Experimental results show that SynPrune consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts. Our method is also robust across varying function lengths and syntax categories.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07033|True
2510.23074|Hiromu Takahashi, Shotaro Ishihara|Fast-MIA: Efficient and Scalable Membership Inference for LLMs|2025|100|We propose Fast-MIA (https://github.com/Nikkei/fast-mia), a Python library for efficiently evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against Large Language Models (LLMs). MIA against LLMs has emerged as a crucial challenge due to growing concerns over copyright, security, and data privacy, and has attracted increasing research attention. However, the progress of this research is significantly hindered by two main obstacles: (1) the high computational cost of inference in LLMs, and (2) the lack of standardized and maintained implementations of MIA methods, which makes large-scale empirical comparison difficult. To address these challenges, our library provides fast batch inference and includes implementations of representative MIA methods under a unified evaluation framework. This library supports easy implementation of reproducible benchmarks with simple configuration and extensibility. We release Fast-MIA as an open-source (Apache License 2.0) tool to support scalable and transparent research on LLMs.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23074|True
2510.20930|Soham Hans, Stacy Marsella, Sophia Hirschmann, Nikolos Gurney|Security Logs to ATT&CK Insights: Leveraging LLMs for High-Level Threat Understanding and Cognitive Trait Inference|2025|100|Understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied on high-level intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains. However, real-time defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and cognitive strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as intrusion detection system (IDS) logs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer attacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases such as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and cognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a highly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely techniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to high-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such as tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to psychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs can bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent, offering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.

2510.19773|Euodia Dodd, Nataša Krčo, Igor Shilov, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye|The Tail Tells All: Estimating Model-Level Membership Inference Vulnerability Without Reference Models|2025|100|Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models, limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region) of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19773|True
2510.10625|Yuval Golbari, Navve Wasserman, Gal Vardi, Michal Irani|ImpMIA: Leveraging Implicit Bias for Membership Inference Attack under Realistic Scenarios|2025|100|Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples. This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10625|True
2510.05699|Meng Tong, Yuntao Du, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Ninghui Li|Membership Inference Attacks on Tokenizers of Large Language Models|2025|100|Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05699|True

Existing approaches often explore the adversarial space poorly, rely on hand-crafted heuristics, or lack systematic query refinement. We present NEXUS (Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences), a modular framework for constructing, refining, and executing optimized multi-turn attacks. NEXUS comprises: (1) ThoughtNet, which hierarchically expands a harmful intent into a structured semantic network of topics, entities, and query chains; (2) a feedback-driven Simulator that iteratively refines and prunes these chains through attacker-victim-judge LLM collaboration using harmfulness and semantic-similarity benchmarks; and (3) a Network Traverser that adaptively navigates the refined query space for real-time attacks. This pipeline uncovers stealthy, high-success adversarial paths across LLMs. On several closed-source and open-source LLMs, NEXUS increases attack success rate by 2.1% to 19.4% over prior methods.

2512.13501|Sabrine Ennaji, Elhadj Benkhelifa, Luigi Vincenzo Mancini|Behavior-Aware and Generalizable Defense Against Black-Box Adversarial Attacks for ML-Based IDS|2025|100|Machine learning based intrusion detection systems are increasingly targeted by black box adversarial attacks, where attackers craft evasive inputs using indirect feedback such as binary outputs or behavioral signals like response time and resource usage. While several defenses have been proposed, including input transformation, adversarial training, and surrogate detection, they often fall short in practice. Most are tailored to specific attack types, require internal model access, or rely on static mechanisms that fail to generalize across evolving attack strategies. Furthermore, defenses such as input transformation can degrade intrusion detection system performance, making them unsuitable for real time deployment.   To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Feature Poisoning, a lightweight and proactive defense mechanism designed specifically for realistic black box scenarios. Adaptive Feature Poisoning assumes that probing can occur silently and continuously, and introduces dynamic and context aware perturbations to selected traffic features, corrupting the attacker feedback loop without impacting detection capabilities. The method leverages traffic profiling, change point detection, and adaptive scaling to selectively perturb features that an attacker is likely exploiting, based on observed deviations.   We evaluate Adaptive Feature Poisoning against multiple realistic adversarial attack strategies, including silent probing, transferability based attacks, and decision boundary based attacks. The results demonstrate its ability to confuse attackers, degrade attack effectiveness, and preserve detection performance. By offering a generalizable, attack agnostic, and undetectable defense, Adaptive Feature Poisoning represents a significant step toward practical and robust adversarial resilience in machine learning based intrusion detection systems.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13501|True

In multi tier Federated IoT (Fed-IoT) systems, unstable connectivity and adversarial interference can silently alter transmitted parameters, degrading convergence. We propose DP-EMAR, a differentially private, error model based autonomous repair framework that detects and reconstructs transmission induced distortions during FL aggregation. DP-EMAR estimates corruption patterns and applies adaptive correction before privacy noise is added, enabling reliable in network repair without violating confidentiality. By integrating Differential Privacy (DP) with Secure Aggregation (SA), the framework distinguishes DP noise from genuine transmission errors. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT sensor and graph datasets show that DP-EMAR preserves convergence stability and maintains near baseline performance under communication corruption while ensuring strict (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantees. The framework enhances robustness, communication efficiency, and trust in privacy preserving Federated IoT learning.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13460|True

Given the stringent reliability demands of applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, robust detection of such adversarial attacks is paramount. In this paper, we investigate the geometric properties of a model's input loss landscape. We analyze the Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) of the model's gradient parameters, which quantifies the minimal number of coordinates required to describe the data points on their underlying manifold. We reveal a distinct and consistent difference in the ID for natural and adversarial data, which forms the basis of our proposed detection method. We validate our approach across two distinct operational scenarios. First, in a batch-wise context for identifying malicious data groups, our method demonstrates high efficacy on datasets like MNIST and SVHN. Second, in the critical individual-sample setting, we establish new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and MS COCO. Our detector significantly surpasses existing methods against a wide array of attacks, including CW and AutoAttack, achieving detection rates consistently above 92\% on CIFAR-10. The results underscore the robustness of our geometric approach, highlighting that intrinsic dimensionality is a powerful fingerprint for adversarial detection across diverse datasets and attack strategies.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12827|True

However, their real-world deployment is complicated by a critical vulnerability: adversarial examples (AEs). Detecting these AEs is challenging because (i) adversarial perturbations are optimized across the entire input sequence and exploit global temporal dependencies, which renders local detection methods ineffective, and (ii) unlike traditional forecasting models with fixed input dimensions, TS-LLMs accept sequences of variable length, increasing variability that complicates detection. To address these challenges, we propose a plug-in detection framework that capitalizes on the TS-LLM's own variable-length input capability. Our method uses sampling-induced divergence as a detection signal. Given an input sequence, we generate multiple shortened variants and detect AEs by measuring the consistency of their forecasts: Benign sequences tend to produce stable predictions under sampling, whereas adversarial sequences show low forecast similarity, because perturbations optimized for a full-length sequence do not transfer reliably to shorter, differently-structured subsamples. We evaluate our approach on three representative TS-LLMs (TimeGPT, TimesFM, and TimeLLM) across three energy datasets: ETTh2 (Electricity Transformer Temperature), NI (Hourly Energy Consumption), and Consumption (Hourly Electricity Consumption and Production). Empirical results confirm strong and robust detection performance across both black-box and white-box attack scenarios, highlighting its practicality as a reliable safeguard for TS-LLM forecasting in real-world energy systems.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12154|True
2512.11783|Andrew Adiletta, Kathryn Adiletta, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar|Super Suffixes: Bypassing Text Generation Alignment and Guard Models Simultaneously|2025|100|The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for enhanced security and privacy measures in Machine Learning (ML). LLMs are increasingly being used to process untrusted text inputs and even generate executable code, often while having access to sensitive system controls. To address these security concerns, several companies have introduced guard models, which are smaller, specialized models designed to protect text generation models from adversarial or malicious inputs. In this work, we advance the study of adversarial inputs by introducing Super Suffixes, suffixes capable of overriding multiple alignment objectives across various models with different tokenization schemes. We demonstrate their effectiveness, along with our joint optimization technique, by successfully bypassing the protection mechanisms of Llama Prompt Guard 2 on five different text generation models for malicious text and code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal that Llama Prompt Guard 2 can be compromised through joint optimization.   Additionally, by analyzing the changing similarity of a model's internal state to specific concept directions during token sequence processing, we propose an effective and lightweight method to detect Super Suffix attacks. We show that the cosine similarity between the residual stream and certain concept directions serves as a distinctive fingerprint of model intent. Our proposed countermeasure, DeltaGuard, significantly improves the detection of malicious prompts generated through Super Suffixes. It increases the non-benign classification rate to nearly 100%, making DeltaGuard a valuable addition to the guard model stack and enhancing robustness against adversarial prompt attacks.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11783|True
2512.11771|Kai Yao, Marc Juarez|Smudged Fingerprints: A Systematic Evaluation of the Robustness of AI Image Fingerprints|2025|100|Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11771|True
2512.11359|Yifan Niu, Aochuan Chen, Tingyang Xu, Jia Li|Attacking and Securing Community Detection: A Game-Theoretic Framework|2025|100|It has been demonstrated that adversarial graphs, i.e., graphs with imperceptible perturbations, can cause deep graph models to fail on classification tasks. In this work, we extend the concept of adversarial graphs to the community detection problem, which is more challenging. We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender. When the interactive game reaches a Nash equilibrium, attacker adopts more imperceptible strategies that can still achieve satisfactory attack effectiveness even after defense.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11359|True

While traditional IDS approaches rely heavily on signature-based methods, they struggle to detect novel and evolving attacks. This paper presents an advanced IDS framework that leverages adversarial training and dynamic neural networks in 5G/6G networks to enhance network security by providing robust, real-time threat detection and response capabilities. Unlike conventional models, which require costly retraining to update knowledge, the proposed framework integrates incremental learning algorithms, reducing the need for frequent retraining. Adversarial training is used to fortify the IDS against poisoned data. By using fewer features and incorporating statistical properties, the system can efficiently detect potential threats. Extensive evaluations using the NSL- KDD dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy of 82.33% for multiclass classification of various network attacks while resisting dataset poisoning. This research highlights the potential of adversarial-trained, dynamic neural networks for building resilient IDS solutions.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10637|True

This work focuses on the analysis and evaluation of these techniques for clustering malware samples using the K-means algorithm.

This survey synthesizes the landscape of AI-enhanced defenses deployed at the edge: (i) anomaly- and behavior-based Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) within broader Web Application and API Protection (WAAP), (ii) adaptive DDoS detection and mitigation, (iii) bot management that resists human-mimicry, and (iv) API discovery, positive security modeling, and encrypted-traffic anomaly analysis.

While these models are predominantly trained on clean, structured code datasets, real-world code often undergoes a variety of semantic-preserving transformations, including refactoring, minification, automated formatting, and compiler optimizations. To address this critical gap between training and test data, we propose Auto-SPT, a novel framework to automatically construct synthetic-data generators for code. Auto-SPT is designed to produce Semantic Preserving Transformations (SPTs) that alter a program's syntactic structure while preserving its functionality and is instantiated on top of Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, we use LLMs to craft a diverse set of SPTs, generate strong implementations for these SPTs, and compose them to result into strong transformations. Our formal analysis shows that the diversity of SPTs impacts the strength of their composition. We then empirically demonstrate that Auto-SPT generates more diverse SPTs than existing approaches and these SPTs significantly drop the performance of state-of-the-art code clone detectors. Further experiments show Auto-SPT can be used to enhance code datasets for training, to produce code-clone detection models that are robust to real-world, adversarial code transformations.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06042|True

While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks. Through extensive experiments on four real-world, family-annotated datasets under both supervised and unsupervised settings, we establish a robust baseline and provide practical insights into the most effective combinations of data abstractions, representation models, and learning paradigms for this challenge.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05288|True

Current approaches, however, overlook two critical challenges: robustness against adversarial source code transformations and adaptability to the varying false positive rate (FPR) requirements of different actors, from repository maintainers (requiring low FPR) to enterprise security teams (higher FPR tolerance).   We introduce a robust detector capable of seamless integration into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems. To ensure robustness, we propose a novel methodology for generating adversarial packages using fine-grained code obfuscation. Combining these with adversarial training (AT) enhances detector robustness by 2.5x. We comprehensively evaluate AT effectiveness by testing our detector against 122,398 packages collected daily from PyPI over 80 days, showing that AT needs careful application: it makes the detector more robust to obfuscations and allows finding 10% more obfuscated packages, but slightly decreases performance on non-obfuscated packages.   We demonstrate production adaptability of our detector via two case studies: (i) one for PyPI maintainers (tuned at 0.1% FPR) and (ii) one for enterprise teams (tuned at 10% FPR). In the former, we analyze 91,949 packages collected from PyPI over 37 days, achieving a daily detection rate of 2.48 malicious packages with only 2.18 false positives. In the latter, we analyze 1,596 packages adopted by a multinational software company, obtaining only 1.24 false positives daily. These results show that our detector can be seamlessly integrated into both public repositories like PyPI and enterprise ecosystems, ensuring a very low time budget of a few minutes to review the false positives.   Overall, we uncovered 346 malicious packages, now reported to the community.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04338|True

While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20799|True

However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments.   This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20456|True

Existing forecasting techniques are limited by the lack of combined robust anomaly mitigation solutions and data privacy preservation. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel anomaly-resilient federated learning framework that simultaneously preserves data privacy, detects cyber-attacks, and maintains trustworthy demand prediction accuracy under adversarial conditions. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: LSTM autoencoder-based distributed anomaly detection deployed at each federated client, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and federated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that enable collaborative learning without centralized data aggregation. The framework is validated on real-world EV charging infrastructure datasets combined with real-world DDoS attack datasets, providing robust validation of the proposed approach under realistic threat scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated approach achieves superior performance compared to centralized models, with 15.2% improvement in R2 accuracy while maintaining data locality. The integrated cyber-attack detection and mitigation system produces trustworthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability, recovering 47.9% of attack-induced performance degradation while maintaining exceptional precision (91.3%) and minimal false positive rates (1.21%). The proposed architecture enables enhanced EV infrastructure planning, privacy-preserving collaborative forecasting, cybersecurity resilience, and rapid recovery from malicious threats across distributed charging networks.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17978|True

However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715|True

Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels.   To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14422|True

2512.13325|Malte Hellmeier|Security and Detectability Analysis of Unicode Text Watermarking Methods Against Large Language Models|2025|100|Securing digital text is becoming increasingly relevant due to the widespread use of large language models. Individuals' fear of losing control over data when it is being used to train such machine learning models or when distinguishing model-generated output from text written by humans. Digital watermarking provides additional protection by embedding an invisible watermark within the data that requires protection. However, little work has been taken to analyze and verify if existing digital text watermarking methods are secure and undetectable by large language models. In this paper, we investigate the security-related area of watermarking and machine learning models for text data. In a controlled testbed of three experiments, ten existing Unicode text watermarking methods were implemented and analyzed across six large language models: GPT-5, GPT-4o, Teuken 7B, Llama 3.3, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. The findings of our experiments indicate that, especially the latest reasoning models, can detect a watermarked text. Nevertheless, all models fail to extract the watermark unless implementation details in the form of source code are provided. We discuss the implications for security researchers and practitioners and outline future research opportunities to address security concerns.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13325|True

While this has unlocked potential for human productivity gains, the attack surface has expanded accordingly: threats now span content safety failures (e.g., harmful or deceptive outputs), model and data integrity compromise (e.g., poisoning, supply-chain tampering), runtime manipulations (e.g., prompt injection, tool and agent misuse), and ecosystem risks (e.g., orchestration abuse, multi-agent collusion). Existing frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-2 Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) taxonomy, and OWASP Top 10s for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI Applications provide valuable viewpoints, but each covers only slices of this multi-dimensional space.

It integrates AI security and AI safety across modalities, agents, pipelines, and the broader ecosystem. The AI Security Framework is designed to be practical for threat identification, red-teaming, risk prioritization, and it is comprehensive in scope and can be extensible to emerging deployments in multimodal contexts, humanoids, wearables, and sensory infrastructures. We analyze gaps in prevailing frameworks, discuss design principles for our framework, and demonstrate how the taxonomy provides structure for understanding how modern AI systems fail, how adversaries exploit these failures, and how organizations can build defenses across the AI lifecycle that evolve alongside capability advancements.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12921|True

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12090|True

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.   To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust.

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.   To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11194|True
2512.10636|David-Alexandre Guiraud, Andrea Tundis, Marc Winstel|Objectives and Design Principles in Offline Payments with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)|2025|100|In this work, fundamental design principles for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) with an offline functionality and corresponding counter measures are discussed. We identify three major objectives for any such CBDC proposal:(i) Access Control Security - protection of a user's funds against unauthorized access by other users; (ii) Security against Depositor's Misbehavior - preservation of the integrity of an environment (potentially the wallet) against misbehavior of its owner (for example, double-spending), and (iii) Privacy by Design - ensuring privacy is embedded into the system architecture. Our central conclusion is the alignment of the objectives to concrete design elements as countermeasures, whereas certain objectives and countermeasures have no or minimal interferences with each other. For example, we work out that the integrity of a user's wallet and, accordingly, the prevention of double-spending race attacks should be addressed through the adoption and integration of \textit{secure hardware} within a CBDC system.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10636|True

Traditional rule based or signature driven detection systems are often inadequate in identifying novel or evolving threats within Identity and Access Management logs, where anomalous behavior may appear statistically benign but contextually malicious. This paper presents a Graph Neural Network Based Adaptive Threat Detection framework designed to learn latent user resource interaction patterns from IAM audit trails in real time. By modeling IAM logs as heterogeneous dynamic graphs, the proposed system captures temporal, relational, and contextual dependencies across entities such as users, roles, sessions, and access actions. The model incorporates attention based aggregation and graph embedding updates to enable continual adaptation to changing cloud environments. Experimental evaluation on synthesized and real world IAM datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves higher detection precision and recall than baseline LSTM and GCN classifiers, while maintaining scalability across multi tenant cloud environments. The frameworks adaptability enables proactive mitigation of insider threats, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks, contributing to the foundation of AI driven zero trust access analytics. This work bridges the gap between graph based machine learning and operational cloud security intelligence.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10280|True

However, it suffers from limited generation diversity and high detection overhead. In parallel, recent research has focused on undetectability, a property ensuring that watermarks remain difficult for adversaries to detect and spoof. In this work, we introduce a new class of watermarking schemes constructed through probabilistic automata. We present two instantiations: (i) a practical scheme with exponential generation diversity and computational efficiency, and (ii) a theoretical construction with formal undetectability guarantees under cryptographic assumptions. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-3B and Mistral-7B validate the superior performance of our scheme in terms of robustness and efficiency.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10185|True

While existing defenses effectively counter obvious threats such as out-of-context trigger words and safety alignment violations, they fail against sophisticated attacks using contextually-appropriate triggers that blend seamlessly into natural language. This paper introduces three novel contextually-aware attack scenarios that exploit domain-specific knowledge and semantic plausibility: the ViralApp attack targeting social media addiction classification, the Fever attack manipulating medical diagnosis toward hypertension, and the Referral attack steering clinical recommendations. These attacks represent realistic threats where malicious actors exploit domain-specific vocabulary while maintaining semantic coherence, demonstrating how adversaries can weaponize contextual appropriateness to evade conventional detection methods. To counter both traditional and these sophisticated attacks, we present \textbf{SCOUT (Saliency-based Classification Of Untrusted Tokens)}, a novel defense framework that identifies backdoor triggers through token-level saliency analysis rather than traditional context-based detection methods. SCOUT constructs a saliency map by measuring how the removal of individual tokens affects the model's output logits for the target label, enabling detection of both conspicuous and subtle manipulation attempts. We evaluate SCOUT on established benchmark datasets (SST-2, IMDB, AG News) against conventional attacks (BadNet, AddSent, SynBkd, StyleBkd) and our novel attacks, demonstrating that SCOUT successfully detects these sophisticated threats while preserving accuracy on clean inputs.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10998|True

Building on insights from O'Flynn and Kuhnapfel et al., we introduce a platform-agnostic framework for Spatial EMFI Mapping and Fault Classification, aimed at understanding how spatial probe position influences fault outcomes. We present pilot experiments on three representative microcontroller targets including the Xtensa LX6 (ESP32) and two ChipWhisper boards not as definitive evaluations, but as illustrative demonstrations of how the proposed methodology can be applied in practice. These preliminary observations motivate a generalized and reproducible workflow that researchers can adopt when analyzing EMFI susceptibility across diverse embedded architectures.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09049|True

However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_χ$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08809|True

Steganography hides the existence of secret data instead of its content, providing better security for multimedia communication. This paper proposes a new technique for hiding audio files inside images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method optimized by the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm. HHO is a nature-inspired metaheuristic that imitates the hunting behavior of Harris hawks to find optimal pixel positions for embedding data. The proposed method is evaluated using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Mean Square Error (MSE). Experimental results show that HHO achieves better image quality, robustness, and embedding capacity compared to existing methods.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08299|True

However, their susceptibility to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), where adversaries aim to infer whether a particular code sample was used during training, poses serious privacy concerns. While MIA has been widely investigated in NLP and vision domains, its effects on security-critical code analysis tasks remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of MIA on VP models, evaluating the attack success across various architectures (LSTM, BiGRU, and CodeBERT) and feature combinations, including embeddings, logits, loss, and confidence. Our threat model aligns with black-box and gray-box settings where prediction outputs are observable, allowing adversaries to infer membership by analyzing output discrepancies between training and non-training samples. The empirical findings reveal that logits and loss are the most informative and vulnerable outputs for membership leakage. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Noise-based Membership Inference Defense (NMID), which is a lightweight defense module that applies output masking and Gaussian noise injection to disrupt adversarial inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NMID significantly reduces MIA effectiveness, lowering the attack AUC from nearly 1.0 to below 0.65, while preserving the predictive utility of VP models. Our study highlights critical privacy risks in code analysis and offers actionable defense strategies for securing AI-powered software systems.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08291|True

With rising climate stress, unpredictable feed prices, and persistent disease threats, poultry producers often struggle to make quick, informed decisions. Therefore, there is a critical need for intelligent, data-driven systems that can deliver reliable, on-demand consultation. This paper presents PoultryTalk, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide real-time expert guidance through text and image-based interaction. PoultryTalk uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and GPT-4o to provide smart, context-aware poultry management advice from text, images, or questions. System usability and performance were evaluated using 200 expert-verified queries and feedback from 34 participants who submitted 267 queries to the PoultryTalk prototype. The expert-verified benchmark queries confirmed strong technical performance, achieving a semantic similarity of 84.0% and an average response latency of 3.6 seconds. Compared with OpenAI's GPT-4o, PoultryTalk delivered more accurate and reliable information related to poultry. Based on participants' evaluations, PoultryTalk achieved a response accuracy of 89.9%, with about 9.1% of responses rated as incorrect. A post-use survey indicated high user satisfaction: 95.6% of participants reported that the chatbot provided "always correct" and "mostly correct" answers. 82.6% indicated they would recommend the tool, and 17.4% responded "maybe." These results collectively demonstrate that PoultryTalk not only delivers accurate, contextually relevant information but also demonstrates strong user acceptance and scalability potential.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08995|True

As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops. These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals. In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments. The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity. The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services. Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07086|True
2512.06925|Aseer Al Faisal|Deep Reinforcement Learning for Phishing Detection with Transformer-Based Semantic Features|2025|100|Phishing is a cybercrime in which individuals are deceived into revealing personal information, often resulting in financial loss. These attacks commonly occur through fraudulent messages, misleading advertisements, and compromised legitimate websites. This study proposes a Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network (QR-DQN) approach that integrates RoBERTa semantic embeddings with handcrafted lexical features to enhance phishing detection while accounting for uncertainties. Unlike traditional DQN methods that estimate single scalar Q-values, QR-DQN leverages quantile regression to model the distribution of returns, improving stability and generalization on unseen phishing data. A diverse dataset of 105,000 URLs was curated from PhishTank, OpenPhish, Cloudflare, and other sources, and the model was evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. The QR-DQN framework achieved a test accuracy of 99.86%, precision of 99.75%, recall of 99.96%, and F1-score of 99.85%, demonstrating high effectiveness. Compared to standard DQN with lexical features, the hybrid QR-DQN with lexical and semantic features reduced the generalization gap from 1.66% to 0.04%, indicating significant improvement in robustness. Five-fold cross-validation confirmed model reliability, yielding a mean accuracy of 99.90% with a standard deviation of 0.04%. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid approach effectively identifies phishing threats, adapts to evolving attack strategies, and generalizes well to unseen data.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06925|True

However, this autonomy creates a largely overlooked security gap. Existing defenses focus on prompt-injection attacks and fail to address threats embedded in tool metadata, leaving MCP-based systems exposed to semantic manipulation. This work analyzes three classes of semantic attacks on MCP-integrated systems: (1) Tool Poisoning, where adversarial instructions are hidden in tool descriptors; (2) Shadowing, where trusted tools are indirectly compromised through contaminated shared context; and (3) Rug Pulls, where descriptors are altered after approval to subvert behavior. To counter these threats, we introduce a layered security framework with three components: RSA-based manifest signing to enforce descriptor integrity, LLM-on-LLM semantic vetting to detect suspicious tool definitions, and lightweight heuristic guardrails that block anomalous tool behavior at runtime. Through evaluation of GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Llama-3.5 across eight prompting strategies, we find that security performance varies widely by model architecture and reasoning method. GPT-4 blocks about 71 percent of unsafe tool calls, balancing latency and safety. DeepSeek shows the highest resilience to Shadowing attacks but with greater latency, while Llama-3.5 is fastest but least robust. Our results show that the proposed framework reduces unsafe tool invocation rates without model fine-tuning or internal modification.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06556|True
2512.06500|Jingkai Mao, Xiaolin Chang|PDRIMA: A Policy-Driven Runtime Integrity Measurement and Attestation Approach for ARM TrustZone-based TEE|2025|100|Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as ARM TrustZone are widely used in IoT and embedded devices to protect sensitive code and data. However, most existing defenses focus on secure boot or REE-side monitoring and provide little visibility into the runtime integrity of the TEE. This leaves TrustZone-based devices exposed to persistent TEE compromises. We propose Policy-Driven Runtime Integrity Measurement and Attestation (PDRIMA), a runtime integrity protection approach for TrustZone-based TEEs. PDRIMA systematically analyzes TEE attack surfaces and introduces two in-TEE subsystems: a Secure Monitor Agent (SMA) that performs policy-driven measurement, appraisal, logging, and time-based re-measurement over the TEE kernel, static components, user-TAs, and security-critical system calls; and a Remote Attestation Agent (RAA) that aggregates tamper-evident evidence and exposes a remote attestation protocol for verifying. We analyze PDRIMA's security against identified attack surfaces, implement a prototype on OP-TEE for Raspberry Pi 3B+, and evaluate its performance overhead to indicate its practicability.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06500|True
2512.06155|Caleb Gross|Sift or Get Off the PoC: Applying Information Retrieval to Vulnerability Research with SiftRank|2025|100|Security research is fundamentally a problem of resource constraint and consequent prioritization. There is simply too much attack surface and too little time and energy to spend analyzing it all. The most effective security researchers are often those who are most skilled at intuitively deciding which part of an expansive attack surface to investigate. We demonstrate that this problem of selecting the most promising option from among many possibilities can be reframed as an information retrieval problem, and solved using document ranking techniques with LLMs performing the heavy lifting as general-purpose rankers. We present SiftRank, a ranking algorithm achieving O(n) complexity through three key mechanisms: listwise ranking using an LLM to order documents in small batches of approximately 10 items at a time; inflection-based convergence detection that adaptively terminates ranking when score distributions have stabilized; and iterative refinement that progressively focuses ranking effort on the most relevant documents. Unlike existing reranking approaches that require a separate first-stage retrieval step to narrow datasets to approximately 100 candidates, SiftRank operates directly on thousands of items, with each document evaluated across multiple randomized batches to mitigate inconsistent judgments by an LLM. We demonstrate practical effectiveness on N-day vulnerability analysis, successfully identifying a vulnerability-fixing function among 2,197 changed functions in a stripped binary firmware patch within 99 seconds at an inference cost of $0.82. Our approach enables scalable security prioritization for problems that are generally constrained by manual analysis, requiring only standard LLM API access without specialized infrastructure, embedding, or domain-specific fine-tuning. An open-source implementation of SiftRank may be found at https://github.com/noperator/siftrank.|https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06155|True
