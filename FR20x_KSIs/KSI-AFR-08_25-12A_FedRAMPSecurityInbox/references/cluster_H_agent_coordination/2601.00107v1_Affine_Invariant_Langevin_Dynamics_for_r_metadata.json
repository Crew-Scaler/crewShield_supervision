  "summary": "We introduce an affine invariant Langevin dynamics (ALDI) framework for the efficient estimation of rare events in nonlinear dynamical systems. Rare events are formulated as Bayesian inverse problems through a nonsmooth limit-state function whose zero level set characterises the event of interest. T"
