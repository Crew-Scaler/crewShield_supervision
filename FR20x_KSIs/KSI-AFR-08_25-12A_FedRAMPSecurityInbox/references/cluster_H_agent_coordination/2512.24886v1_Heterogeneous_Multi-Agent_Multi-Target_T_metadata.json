  "summary": "Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generaliz"
