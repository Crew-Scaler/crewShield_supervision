  "summary": "Multi-Party Private Set Intersection (MP-PSI) with threshold enhances the flexibility of MP-PSI by disclosing elements present in at least $t$ participants' sets, rather than requiring elements to appear in all $n$ sets. In scenarios where each participant is responsible for its dataset, e.g., digit"
