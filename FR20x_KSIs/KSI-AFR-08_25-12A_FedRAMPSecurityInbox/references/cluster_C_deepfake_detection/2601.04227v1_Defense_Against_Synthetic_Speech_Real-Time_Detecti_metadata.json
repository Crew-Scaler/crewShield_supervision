  "summary": "Generative audio technologies now enable highly realistic voice cloning and real-time voice conversion, increasing the risk of impersonation, fraud, and misinformation in communication channels such as phone and video calls. This study investigates real-time detection of AI-generated speech produced by RealTimeVoiceCloning (RVC), a popular real-time voice conversion framework used for creating deepfakes."
