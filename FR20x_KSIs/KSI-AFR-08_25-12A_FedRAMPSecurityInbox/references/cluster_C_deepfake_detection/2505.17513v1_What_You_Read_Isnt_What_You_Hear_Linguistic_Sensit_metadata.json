  "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level perturbations and proposed detection mechanisms that are robust to audio perturbations but fail when the underlying linguistic content is modified."
