  "summary": "Large language models increasingly require structured inference, from JSON schema enforcement to multi-lingual parsing, where outputs must satisfy complex constraints. We introduce MetaJuLS, a meta-reinforcement learning approach that learns universal constraint propagation policies applicable acros"
