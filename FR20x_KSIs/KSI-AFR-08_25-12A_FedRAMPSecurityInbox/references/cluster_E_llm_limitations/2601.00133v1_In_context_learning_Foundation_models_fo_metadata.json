  "summary": "Foundation models (FMs) have recently shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities across diverse scientific domains. In this work, we introduce a unified in-context learning foundation model (ICL-FM) framework for materials property prediction that integrates both composition-based and s"
