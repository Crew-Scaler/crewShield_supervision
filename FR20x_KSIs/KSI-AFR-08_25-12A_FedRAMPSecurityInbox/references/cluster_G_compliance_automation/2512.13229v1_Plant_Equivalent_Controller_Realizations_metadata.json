  "summary": "As cyber-physical systems (CPSs) become more dependent on data and communication networks, their vulnerability to false data injection (FDI) attacks has raised significant concerns. Among these, stealthy attacks, those that evade conventional detection mechanisms, pose a critical threat to closed-lo"
