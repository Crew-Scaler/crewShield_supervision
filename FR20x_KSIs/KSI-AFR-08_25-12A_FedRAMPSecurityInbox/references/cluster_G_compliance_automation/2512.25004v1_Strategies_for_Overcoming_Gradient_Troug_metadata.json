  "summary": "The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) provides a promising approach for simulating highly correlated quantum systems on quantum devices, as it strikes a balance between hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy. Although ADAPT-VQE avoids"
