Abstract:
Architectural backdoors pose an under-examined but critical threat to deep neural networks, embedding malicious logic directly into a model's computational graph. Unlike traditional data poisoning or parameter manipulation, architectural backdoors evade standard mitigation techniques and persist even after clean retraining. This survey systematically consolidates research on architectural backdoors, spanning compiler-level manipulations, tainted AutoML pipelines, and supply-chain vulnerabilities...

Relevance Justification:
Addresses training data poisoning attacks; Discusses backdoor attacks in ML models; Covers embedding-based attacks
