Abstract:
Cyberattack detection in Critical Infrastructure and Supply Chains has become challenging in Industry 4.0. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are deployed to counter the cyberattacks. However, an IDS effectively detects attacks based on the known signatures and patterns, Zero-day attacks go undetected. To overcome this drawback in IDS, the integration of a Dense Neural Network (DNN) with Data Augmentation is proposed. It makes IDS intelligent and enables it to self-learn with high accuracy when a...
