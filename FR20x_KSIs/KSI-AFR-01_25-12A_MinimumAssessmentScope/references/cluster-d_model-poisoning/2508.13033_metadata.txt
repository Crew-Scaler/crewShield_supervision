Abstract:
The rapid adoption of chiplet-based heterogeneous integration is reshaping semiconductor design by enabling modular, scalable, and faster time-to-market solutions for AI and high-performance computing. However, multi-vendor assembly in post-fabrication environments fragments the supply chain and exposes SiP systems to serious security threats, including cloning, overproduction, and chiplet substitution. Existing authentication solutions depend on trusted integrators or centralized security ancho...

Relevance Justification:
Covers AI supply chain security; Addresses RAG pipeline attacks
