Abstract:
The rise of supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages demands robust detection solutions. Current approaches, however, overlook two critical challenges: robustness against adversarial source code transformations and adaptability to the varying false positive rate (FPR) requirements of different actors, from repository maintainers (requiring low FPR) to enterprise security teams (higher FPR tolerance).
  We introduce a robust detector capable of seamless integration into both public repo...
