Abstract:
Private information retrieval (PIR) is an essential cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving applications, enabling a client to retrieve a record from a server's database without revealing which record was requested. Single-server PIR based on homomorphic encryption has particularly gained immense attention for its ease of deployment and reduced trust assumptions. However, single-server PIR remains impractical due to its high computational and memory bandwidth demands. Specifically, reading...
