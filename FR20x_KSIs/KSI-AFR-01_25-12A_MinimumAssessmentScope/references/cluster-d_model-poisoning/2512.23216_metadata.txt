Abstract:
In todays scenario, various organizations store their sensitive data in the cloud environment. Multiple problems are present while retrieving and storing vast amounts of data, such as the frequency of data requests (increasing the computational overhead of the server) and data leakage while storing. To cope with said problem, Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is one of the potential security and access control techniques for secure data storage and authorization. The proposed work divides into tw...
