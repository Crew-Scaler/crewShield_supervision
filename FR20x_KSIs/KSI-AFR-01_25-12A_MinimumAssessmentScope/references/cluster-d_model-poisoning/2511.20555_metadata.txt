Abstract:
Command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing tests programs by mutating both command-line options and input file contents, thus enabling discovery of vulnerabilities that only manifest under specific option-input combinations. Prior works of CLI fuzzing face the challenges of generating semantics-rich option strings and input files, which cannot reach deeply embedded target functions. This often leads to a misdetection of such a deep vulnerability using existing CLI fuzzing techniques. In this paper, we...
