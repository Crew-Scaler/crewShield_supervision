Abstract:
Adversaries (hackers) attempting to infiltrate networks frequently face uncertainty in their operational environments. This research explores the ability to model and detect when they exhibit ambiguity aversion, a cognitive bias reflecting a preference for known (versus unknown) probabilities. We introduce a novel methodological framework that (1) leverages rich, multi-modal data from human-subjects red-team experiments, (2) employs a large language model (LLM) pipeline to parse unstructured log...

Relevance Justification:
Addresses RAG pipeline attacks
