Abstract:
Security of software supply chains is necessary to ensure that software updates do not contain maliciously injected code or introduce vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of critical infrastructure. Verifying the integrity of software updates involves binary differential analysis (binary diffing) to highlight the changes between two binary versions by incorporating binary analysis and reverse engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to binary analysis to augment t...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses backdoor attacks in ML models; Covers AI supply chain security
