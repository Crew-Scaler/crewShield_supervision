Abstract:
Contemporary e-mail services have high availability expectations from the customers and are resource-strained because of the high-volume throughput and spam attacks. Deep Machine Learning architectures, which are resource hungry and require off-line processing due to the long processing times, are not acceptable at the front line filters. On the other hand, the bulk of the incoming spam is not sophisticated enough to bypass even the simplest algorithms. While the small fraction of the intelligen...
