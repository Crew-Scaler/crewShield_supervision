Abstract:
As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, they also become prime targets for adversarial attacks. Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data. Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by analyzing feature representations thr...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses backdoor attacks in ML models; Analyzes trigger-based attacks
