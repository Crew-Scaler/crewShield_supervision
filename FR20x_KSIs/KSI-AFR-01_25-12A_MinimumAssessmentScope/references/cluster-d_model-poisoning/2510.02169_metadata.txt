Abstract:
The growing integration of open-source software and AI-driven technologies has introduced new layers of complexity into the software supply chain, challenging existing methods for dependency management and system assurance. While Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have become critical for enhancing transparency and traceability, current frameworks fall short in capturing the unique characteristics of AI systems -- namely, their dynamic, data-driven nature and the loosely coupled dependencies ac...

Relevance Justification:
Covers AI supply chain security; Addresses RAG pipeline attacks
