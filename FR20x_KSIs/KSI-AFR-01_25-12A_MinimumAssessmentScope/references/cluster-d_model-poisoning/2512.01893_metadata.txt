Abstract:
Phishing remains a persistent cybersecurity threat; however, developing scalable and effective user training is labor-intensive and challenging to maintain. Generative Artificial Intelligence offers an interesting opportunity, but empirical evidence on its instructional efficacy remains scarce. This paper provides an experimental validation of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous engines for generating phishing resilience training. Across two controlled studies (N=480), we demonstrate that...
