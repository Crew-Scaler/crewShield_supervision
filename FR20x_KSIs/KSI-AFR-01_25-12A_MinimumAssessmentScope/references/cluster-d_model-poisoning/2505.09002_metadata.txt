Abstract:
The emergence of chiplet-based heterogeneous integration is transforming the semiconductor, AI, and high-performance computing industries by enabling modular designs and improved scalability. However, assembling chiplets from multiple vendors after fabrication introduces a complex supply chain that raises serious security concerns, including counterfeiting, overproduction, and unauthorized access. Current solutions often depend on dedicated security chiplets or changes to the timing flow, which ...

Relevance Justification:
Covers AI supply chain security; Addresses RAG pipeline attacks
