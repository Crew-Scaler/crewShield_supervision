Abstract:
Industry 5.0's increasing integration of IT and OT systems is transforming industrial operations but also expanding the cyber-physical attack surface. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face escalating security challenges as traditional siloed defences fail to provide coherent, cross-domain threat insights. We present BRIDG-ICS (BRIDge for Industrial Control Systems), an AI-driven Knowledge Graph (KG) framework for context-aware threat analysis and quantitative assessment of cyber resilience in sm...

Relevance Justification:
Addresses RAG pipeline attacks
