Abstract:
Software fuzzing has become a cornerstone in automated vulnerability discovery, yet existing mutation strategies often lack semantic awareness, leading to redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states. In this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow information, which is transformed into structured promp...
