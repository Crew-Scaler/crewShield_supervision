Abstract:
The rapid advancement of deep learning has turned models into highly valuable assets due to their reliance on massive data and costly training processes. However, these models are increasingly vulnerable to leakage and theft, highlighting the critical need for robust intellectual property protection. Model watermarking has emerged as an effective solution, with black-box watermarking gaining significant attention for its practicality and flexibility. Nonetheless, existing black-box methods often...
