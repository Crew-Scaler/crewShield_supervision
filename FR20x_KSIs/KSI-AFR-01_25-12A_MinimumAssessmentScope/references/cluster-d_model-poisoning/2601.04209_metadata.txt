Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools across the medical environment, supporting clinical, research, and administrative workflows. However, strict privacy and network security regulations in hospital settings require that sensitive data be processed within fully local infrastructures. Within this context, we developed and evaluated a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to recommend research collaborators based on PubMed publications authored ...

Relevance Justification:
Addresses RAG pipeline attacks; Covers embedding-based attacks
