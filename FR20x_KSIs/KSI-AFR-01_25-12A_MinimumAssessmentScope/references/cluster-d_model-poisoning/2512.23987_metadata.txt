Abstract:
Confronting the substantial challenges of malware detection in cybersecurity necessitates solutions that are both robust and adaptable to the ever-evolving threat environment. The paper introduces Meta Learning Malware Detection (MeLeMaD), a novel framework leveraging the adaptability and generalization capabilities of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for malware detection. MeLeMaD incorporates a novel feature selection technique, Chunk-wise Feature Selection based on Gradient Boosting (CFSGB...
