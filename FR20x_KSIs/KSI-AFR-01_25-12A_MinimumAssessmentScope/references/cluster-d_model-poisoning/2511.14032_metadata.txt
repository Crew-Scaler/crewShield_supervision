Abstract:
Digital content distribution and proprietary research-driven industries face persistent risks from intellectual property theft and unauthorized redistribution. Conventional encryption schemes such as AES, TDES, ECC, and ElGamal provide strong cryptographic guarantees, but they remain fundamentally agnostic to where decryption takes place. In practice, this means that once a decryption key is leaked or intercepted, any adversary can misuse the key to decrypt the protected content from any locatio...

Relevance Justification:
Addresses RAG pipeline attacks
