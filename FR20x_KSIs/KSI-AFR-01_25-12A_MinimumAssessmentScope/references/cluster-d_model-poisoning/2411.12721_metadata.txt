Abstract:
Cyber-physical systems rely on sensors, communication, and computing, all powered by integrated circuits (ICs). ICs are largely susceptible to various hardware attacks with malicious intents. One of the stealthiest threats is the insertion of a hardware trojan into the IC, causing the circuit to malfunction or leak sensitive information. Due to supply chain vulnerabilities, ICs face risks of trojan insertion during various design and fabrication stages. These trojans typically remain inactive un...

Relevance Justification:
Analyzes trojan/backdoor detection; Covers AI supply chain security; Addresses RAG pipeline attacks
