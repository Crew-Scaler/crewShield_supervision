Abstract:
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supp...

Discusses backdoor attacks in ML models; Analyzes trojan/backdoor detection; Covers AI supply chain security
