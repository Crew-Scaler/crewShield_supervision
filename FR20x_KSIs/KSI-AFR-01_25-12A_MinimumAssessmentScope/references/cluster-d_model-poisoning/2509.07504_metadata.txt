Abstract:
Backdoor (trojan) attacks embed hidden, controllable behaviors into machine-learning models so that models behave normally on benign inputs but produce attacker-chosen outputs when a trigger is present. This survey reviews the rapidly growing literature on backdoor attacks and defenses in the computer-vision domain. We introduce a multi-dimensional taxonomy that organizes attacks and defenses by injection stage (dataset poisoning, model/parameter modification, inference-time injection), trigger ...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses backdoor attacks in ML models; Analyzes trojan/backdoor detection; Analyzes trigger-based attacks
