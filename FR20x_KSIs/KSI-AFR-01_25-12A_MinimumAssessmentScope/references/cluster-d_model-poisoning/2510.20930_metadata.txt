Abstract:
Understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied on high-level intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains. However, real-time defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and cognitive strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as intrusion detection system (IDS) logs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer attacker actions in terms of MITR...
