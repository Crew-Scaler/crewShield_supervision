Abstract:
The advances of large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for automated software vulnerability repair approaches, which iteratively refine the patch until it becomes plausible. Nevertheless, existing LLM-based vulnerability repair approaches face notable limitations: 1) they ignore the concern of locations that need to be patched and focus solely on the repair content. 2) they lack quality assessment for generated candidate patches in the iterative process.
  To tackle the two limitations,...
