Abstract:
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal text generation, yet their rapid adoption raises increasing concerns about security vulnerabilities. Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at th...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses backdoor attacks in ML models; Addresses RAG pipeline attacks; Analyzes trigger-based attacks
