Abstract:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is gaining recognition as one of the key technological axes for next generation information retrieval, owing to its ability to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon in Large Language
  Models (LLMs)and effectively incorporate up-to-date information. However, specialized expertise is necessary to
  construct ahigh-quality retrieval system independently; moreover, RAGdemonstratesrelativelyslowerprocessing
  speeds compared to conventional pure retrieval systems...

Relevance Justification:
Addresses RAG pipeline attacks; Covers embedding-based attacks
