Abstract:
The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing has been a tool ,seeking to secure data i...
