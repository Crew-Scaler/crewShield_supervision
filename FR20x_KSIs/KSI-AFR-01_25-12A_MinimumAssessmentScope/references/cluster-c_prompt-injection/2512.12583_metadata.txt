Abstract:
Prompt injection attacks can compromise the security and stability of critical systems, from infrastructure to large web applications. This work curates and augments a prompt injection dataset based on the HackAPrompt Playground Submissions corpus and trains several classifiers, including LSTM, feed forward neural networks, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to detect malicious prompts in LLM integrated web applications. The proposed approach improves prompt injection detection and mitigation, help...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks
