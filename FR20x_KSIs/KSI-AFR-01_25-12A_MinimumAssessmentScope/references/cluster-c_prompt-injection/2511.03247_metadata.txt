Abstract:
Open-weight models provide researchers and developers with accessible foundations for diverse downstream applications. We tested the safety and security postures of eight open-weight large language models (LLMs) to identify vulnerabilities that may impact subsequent fine-tuning and deployment. Using automated adversarial testing, we measured each model's resilience against single-turn and multi-turn prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Our findings reveal pervasive vulnerabilities across all ...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Analyzes adversarial attacks on language models
