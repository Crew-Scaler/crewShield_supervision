Abstract:
Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Analyzes adversarial attacks on language models; Addresses safety guardrails and alignment
