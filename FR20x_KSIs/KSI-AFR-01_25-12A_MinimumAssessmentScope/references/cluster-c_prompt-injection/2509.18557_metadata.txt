Abstract:
Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI (only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This characteristic introduces substantial security risk...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
