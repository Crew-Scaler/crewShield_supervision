Abstract:
We introduce UIXPOSE, a source-code-agnostic framework that operates on both compiled and open-source apps. This framework applies Intention Behaviour Alignment (IBA) to mobile malware analysis, aligning UI-inferred intent with runtime semantics. Previous work either infers intent statically, e.g., permission-centric, or widget-level or monitors coarse dynamic signals (endpoints, partial resource usage) that miss content and context. UIXPOSE infers an intent vector from each screen using vision-...
