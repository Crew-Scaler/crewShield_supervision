Abstract:
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about the robustness of their safety alignment. While existing jailbreak studies explore both single-turn and multi-turn strategies, most implicitly assume a static safety boundary and fail to account for how contextual interactions dynamically influence model behavior, leading to limited stability and generalization. Motivated by this gap, we propose MEEA (Mere Exposure Effect Attack), a psychology-inspired, fully au...

Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
