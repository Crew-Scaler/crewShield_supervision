Abstract:
As smart tourism evolves, AI-powered chatbots have become indispensable for delivering personalized, real-time assistance to travelers while promoting sustainability and efficiency. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where adversaries manipulate inputs to elicit unintended behaviors such as leaking sensitive information or generating harmful content. This paper presents a case study on the design and implementation of a secure retrieval-augmented gene...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Analyzes adversarial attacks on language models; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
