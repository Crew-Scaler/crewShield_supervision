Abstract:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustnes...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Analyzes adversarial attacks on language models; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
