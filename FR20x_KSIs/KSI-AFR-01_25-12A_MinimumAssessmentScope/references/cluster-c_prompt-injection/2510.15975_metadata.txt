Abstract:
The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the biosciences is transforming biotechnology, medicine, and synthetic biology. Yet this advancement is intrinsically linked to new vulnerabilities, as GenAI lowers the barrier to misuse and introduces novel biosecurity threats, such as generating synthetic viral proteins or toxins. These dual-use risks are often overlooked, as existing safety guardrails remain fragile and can be circumvented through deceptive prompts or jailbre...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks; Addresses safety guardrails and alignment
