Abstract:
Prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks pose persistent security challenges to large language model (LLM)-based systems. We present an efficient and systematically evaluated defense architecture that mitigates these threats through a lightweight, multi-stage pipeline. Its core component is a semantic filter based on text normalization, TF-IDF representations, and a Linear SVM classifier. Despite its simplicity, this module achieves 93.4% accuracy and 96.5% specificity on held-out data, substan...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
