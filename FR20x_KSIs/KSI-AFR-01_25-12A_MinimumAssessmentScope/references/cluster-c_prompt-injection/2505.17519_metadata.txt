Abstract:
In the era of rapid generative AI development, interactions with large language models (LLMs) pose increasing risks of misuse. Prior research has primarily focused on attacks using template-based prompts and optimization-oriented methods, while overlooking the fact that LLMs possess strong unconstrained deceptive capabilities to attack other LLMs. This paper introduces a novel jailbreaking method inspired by the Chain-of-Thought mechanism. The attacker employs mission transfer to conceal harmful...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
