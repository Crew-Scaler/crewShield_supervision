Abstract:
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, ensuring their safety, robustness, and privacy compliance has become critical. We present OpenGuardrails, the first fully open-source platform that unifies large-model-based safety detection, manipulation defense, and deployable guardrail infrastructure. OpenGuardrails protects against three major classes of risks: (1) content-safety violations such as harmful or explicit text generation, (2) model-manipula...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
