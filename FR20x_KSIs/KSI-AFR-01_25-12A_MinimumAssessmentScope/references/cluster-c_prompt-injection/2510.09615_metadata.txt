Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into biomedical research workflows--from literature triage and hypothesis generation to experimental design--yet this expanded utility also heightens dual-use concerns, including the potential misuse for guiding toxic compound synthesis. In response, this study shows a Biosecurity Agent that comprises four coordinated modes across the model lifecycle: dataset sanitization, preference alignment, run-time guardrails, and automated red teamin...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Addresses safety guardrails and alignment; Focuses on AI agent security
