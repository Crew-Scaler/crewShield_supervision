Abstract:
Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generatio...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Analyzes adversarial attacks on language models; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
