Abstract:
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have become widely used for enhancing large language model capabilities, but they introduce significant security vulnerabilities through prompt injection attacks. We present a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating prompt injection risks in RAG-enabled AI agents and propose a multi-layered defense framework. Our benchmark includes 847 adversarial test cases across five attack categories: direct injection, context manipulation, instruction override, da...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Analyzes adversarial attacks on language models; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks
