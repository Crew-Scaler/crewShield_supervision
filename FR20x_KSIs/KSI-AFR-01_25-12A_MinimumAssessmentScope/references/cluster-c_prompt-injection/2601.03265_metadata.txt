Abstract:
This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strateg...
