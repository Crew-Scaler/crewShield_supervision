Abstract:
Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit significant vulnerability to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses d...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks; Focuses on AI agent security
