Abstract:
Frontier AI developers may fail to align or control highly-capable AI agents. In many cases, it could be useful to have emergency shutdown mechanisms which effectively prevent misaligned agents from carrying out harmful actions in the world. We introduce password-activated shutdown protocols (PAS protocols) -- methods for designing frontier agents to implement a safe shutdown protocol when given a password. We motivate PAS protocols by describing intuitive use-cases in which they mitigate risks ...

Relevance Justification:
Focuses on AI agent security
