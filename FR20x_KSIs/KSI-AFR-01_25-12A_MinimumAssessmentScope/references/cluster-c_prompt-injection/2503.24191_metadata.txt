Abstract:
Content Warning: This paper may contain unsafe or harmful content generated by LLMs that may be offensive to readers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used as tooling platforms through structured output APIs to ensure syntax compliance so that robust integration with existing software, like agent systems, can be achieved. However, the feature enabling the functionality of grammar-guided structured output presents significant security vulnerabilities. In this work, we reveal a critica...

Relevance Justification:
Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Proposes defense mechanisms against attacks; Addresses safety guardrails and alignment
