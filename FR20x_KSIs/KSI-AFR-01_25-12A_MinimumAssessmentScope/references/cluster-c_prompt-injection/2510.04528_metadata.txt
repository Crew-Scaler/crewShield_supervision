Abstract:
The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise systems exposes vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks, strategic deception, and biased outputs, threatening security, trust, and fairness. Extending our adversarial activation patching framework (arXiv:2507.09406), which induced deception in toy networks at a 23.9% rate, we introduce the Unified Threat Detection and Mitigation Framework (UTDMF), a scalable, real-time pipeline for enterprise-grade models like Llama-3.1 (405B),...

Relevance Justification:
Directly addresses prompt injection attacks; Discusses LLM jailbreaking techniques; Analyzes adversarial attacks on language models
