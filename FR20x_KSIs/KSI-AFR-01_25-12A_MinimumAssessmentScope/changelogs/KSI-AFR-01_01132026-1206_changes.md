## SCOPE REFINEMENT NOTES

**Questions Moved to Other KSIs** (not removed; prioritized for different KSI focus):

*Incident Response / Forensics KSI*:
- Deep forensic analysis of poisoned models (parameter extraction, gradient analysis)
- Tabletop exercises and incident simulation capabilities
- General AI incident response playbook development

*Supply Chain / Third-Party Risk KSI*:
- Third-party component vulnerability scanning and remediation timelines
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) maintenance
- Supply chain incident notification procedures
- Model security assessment and assessment documentation

*AI Governance / Organizational Readiness KSI*:
- AI Governance function establishment and organizational structure
- Staffing requirements and specialized role identification
- Training and certification requirements for AI compliance
- Budget and resource estimation for FedRAMP 20x AI continuous validation

**Consolidations Applied**:
- Merged multiple SLA questions into single comprehensive SLA items
- Combined similar infrastructure scale-change questions into unified question
- Consolidated governance tradeoff choices (autonomy vs control) into single decision question
