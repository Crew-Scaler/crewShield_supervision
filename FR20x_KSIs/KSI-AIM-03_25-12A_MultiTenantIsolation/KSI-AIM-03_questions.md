**KSI-AIM-03-Q01:** How do you enforce cryptographic isolation boundaries between customer audit logs in multi-tenant environments? Document: (a) isolation mechanisms (separate encryption keys per tenant, cryptographic compartmentalization), (b) incident response visibility (cross-tenant access restricted unless necessary), (c) validation procedures (quarterly isolation testing), (d) examples of isolation violations discovered/remediated, (e) compliance evidence for multi-tenant separation.

**KSI-AIM-03-Q02:** What procedures prevent inference attacks where one tenant's logs leak information about another tenant's infrastructure or behavior? Explain: (a) threat model (what information could be inferred from log patterns?), (b) defenses (aggregation, noise injection, pattern masking), (c) validation (statistical analysis confirming no information leakage), (d) examples of attempted inference attacks, (e) tenant trust in isolation mechanisms.

**KSI-AIM-03-Q03:** How do you handle incident response requiring cross-tenant log visibility while maintaining tenant isolation? Document: (a) cross-tenant access authorization (approval procedures, scope limitations), (b) audit logging of cross-tenant access, (c) tenant notification (informed of shared log access?), (d) time-limiting cross-tenant access (temporary, then revoked), (e) examples of incidents requiring careful cross-tenant coordination.

**KSI-AIM-03-Q04:** What technical mechanisms prevent shared infrastructure log leakage between tenants? Describe: (a) shared component identification (which infrastructure shared?), (b) log separation (customer A logs isolated from customer B), (c) testing validation (confirming separation effectiveness), (d) monitoring for isolation failures, (e) research findings (multi-tenant isolation complexity, failure vectors).

**KSI-AIM-03-Q05:** How do you communicate multi-tenant isolation capabilities to customers and compliance auditors? Provide: (a) documentation (architecture explaining isolation), (b) audit evidence (test results, monitoring data), (c) regulatory compliance (GDPR, FedRAMP requirements), (d) customer SLA commitments on isolation, (e) third-party validation (penetration testing confirming isolation).

**KSI-AIM-03-Q06:** How do you prevent cross-tenant inference attacks where data patterns reveal information about other tenants' infrastructure or AI activities? Provide: (a) inference pattern analysis (what information could be inferred from noise/queries about other tenants?), (b) defenses against inference (query result noise, differential privacy, careful design), (c) evaluation of inference attack resistance, (d) monitoring for suspicious query patterns suggesting inference attempts, (e) evidence of tested inference attack resistance.

**KSI-AIM-03-Q07:** What incident response procedures activate if cross-tenant data leakage is suspected? Describe: (a) detection mechanisms identifying suspicious cross-tenant data access, (b) containment procedures (isolate affected tenants, review access logs), (c) forensic analysis determining scope of leakage, (d) notification and remediation procedures, (e) evidence of past incidents detected and how they were resolved.

**KSI-AIM-03-Q08:** How do you validate multi-tenant isolation through independent security assessment? Document: (a) scope of isolation testing (data, inference, timing-based attacks), (b) test methodology and thoroughness, (c) third-party validation (independent assessor confirmation), (d) frequency of isolation re-testing (annual, continuous), (e) audit evidence suitable for regulatory review and customer assurance.
