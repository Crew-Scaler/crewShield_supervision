**Data Source:** Consolidated from auditor, CIO, and customer discovery question sets; refined based on human review feedback
**Filtering Criteria (Applied 2026-01-13):**
- **Kept (Immutability-Focused):** Credential immutability (Q1-Q2), privilege immutability and strictly-scoped permissions (Q3-Q6), artifact supply chain integrity (Q7-Q12), container/artifact immutability (Q13-Q17), IaC and drift detection (Q18-Q22), baseline immutability and tamper-proof logs (Q23-Q25)
- **Removed/Moved:** General agent identity frameworks, auth latency SLOs, delegation protocols (→ KSI-IAM-07); privilege escalation path analysis, behavioral anomaly detection (→ KSI-CNA-08); general audit trail design, compliance automation, governance at scale (→ KSI-CMT-01/CMT-03/MLA-07)
- **Result:** 25 core immutable infrastructure questions vs. original 40 (15 questions moved to domain-specific KSIs)

**Research Basis:** 229 papers synthesized emphasizing immutable infrastructure, artifact supply chain integrity, strictly-defined privilege models, and cryptographic audit trail integrity. Key findings: SLSA L3 becoming table-stakes, cryptographic artifact verification essential for supply chain security, IaC and drift detection core to infrastructure immutability, credential and privilege immutability prevent tampering.
