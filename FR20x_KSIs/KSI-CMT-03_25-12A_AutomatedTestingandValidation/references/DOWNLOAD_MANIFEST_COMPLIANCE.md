## Key Findings

### Regulatory Landscape
- EU AI Act enacted March 2024, high-risk obligations by August 2026
- NIST AI RMF widespread voluntary adoption
- ISO 42001 emerging as global governance backbone (76% adoption intent)

### Automation Necessity
- Manual compliance unsustainable at scale
- Real-time continuous monitoring becoming standard
- Policy-to-code translation enabling automated validation

### Critical Gaps
- Sector-specific automation (HIPAA, PCI-DSS) under-researched
- Audit tool reliability and "audit washing" concerns
- Multi-jurisdictional compliance harmonization needed
