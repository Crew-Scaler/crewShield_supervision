KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

ATTACK SOPHISTICATION:
- Multi-stage exploitation chains combining jailbreak + context poisoning + extraction
- Latent space discontinuities enable universal attacks across 7+ different LLMs
- Real-world zero-click exploits with privilege escalation capabilities
- Black-box model extraction costing only $12 with 86%+ success rate

DEFENSE MECHANISMS IDENTIFIED:
- Three-stage detection pipelines achieving 96%+ accuracy on semantic attacks
- Latent polytope-based anomaly detection with 91.5%+ AUROC
- FSM-based specification languages enabling conformance verification
- Asynchronous monitoring with 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate
- Ensemble approaches combining multiple detection strategies

INFRASTRUCTURE VULNERABILITIES:
- Context management degradation in extended multi-turn conversations
- Configuration exposure through agent infrastructure analysis
- Privilege escalation vectors in bash/system administration scenarios
- Cache-based side channels for information leakage

CRITICAL GAPS:
- Limited papers on coordinated multi-stage attack orchestration
- Few infrastructure-specific hardening recommendations
- Need for dynamic defense adaptation to novel attack patterns
- Cost-benefit analysis of defense implementations lacking

QUERY REFINEMENT LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

FAILED QUERY 1 ANALYSIS:
- Specific terminology ("configuration exfiltration") has zero ArXiv matches
- Compound boolean queries (4+ concepts) require broader term selection
- Solution: Use established terminology from existing papers
- Lesson: Check ArXiv for standard terminology before crafting complex queries

SUCCESSFUL QUERY STRATEGY:
- Queries 2-4 used broader but standard terms from paper titles/abstracts
- "Jailbreak" + "prompt injection" combined had 50 results (broader search)
- "Multi-turn" + "context poisoning" had 19 results (more specific)
- "Configuration" + "sensitive data" had 50 results (infrastructure focus)
- Combining queries increased coverage without duplication

DEDUPLICATION RESULTS:
- No duplicate papers across three queries
- Papers are naturally distributed across security threat categories
- Relevance scoring effectively separated top papers from borderline

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

FOR ISSUE #64 IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Prioritize VET framework for configuration verification
2. Implement latent polytope monitoring for context drift detection
3. Deploy three-stage detection pipeline (MCP-Guard architecture)
4. Establish FSM-based specification for multi-turn interactions
5. Implement asynchronous monitoring for agent control
6. Establish isolated execution environments (BashArena reference)

FOR FUTURE RESEARCH:
1. Investigate coordinated multi-stage attack chains
2. Develop infrastructure-hardening guidelines
3. Build cost-benefit models for defense mechanisms
4. Study cross-domain context poisoning scenarios
5. Analyze detection evasion techniques

FOR QUERY OPTIMIZATION:
1. Avoid proprietary terminology ("configuration exfiltration")
2. Use established paper keywords (jailbreak, prompt injection, multi-turn)
3. Combine 2-3 core concepts per query for optimal results
4. Expect 19-50 results per query (2024-2025 papers)
5. Apply relevance scoring to select top 10-20%
