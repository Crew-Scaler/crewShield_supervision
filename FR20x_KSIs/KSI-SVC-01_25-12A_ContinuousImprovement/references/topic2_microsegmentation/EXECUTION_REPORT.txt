================================================================================
KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. ZERO-TRUST AS FOUNDATION
   Multiple papers (2502.03614, 2501.06281, 2508.04526) establish that zero-trust
   architectures are essential for implementing adaptive microsegmentation. The
   principle of "never trust, always verify" enables dynamic policy enforcement.

2. ADAPTIVE ML SYSTEMS
   Papers 2501.09033 and 2512.10280 demonstrate that machine learning systems
   with continual learning capabilities can adapt to evolving threats in real-time,
   critical for microsegmentation effectiveness.

3. IDENTITY-BASED SEGMENTATION
   2501.06281 shows that modern approaches focus on identity and behavioral patterns
   rather than static network boundaries, enabling context-aware, dynamic segmentation.

4. POLICY FORMALIZATION
   2508.04526 emphasizes the importance of formal policy design and verification
   using tools like UPPAAL, ensuring policies are correct and auditable.

5. DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS
   2512.19563 and 2506.22745 show that microsegmentation must work across
   distributed systems, requiring decentralized control and edge-native designs.

6. ML ALGORITHMS FOR DETECTION
   Key algorithms identified: XGBoost, Random Forest, Graph Neural Networks (GNN),
   LSTM, multi-agent reinforcement learning, behavioral analytics.

1. Limited papers specifically on "adaptive microsegmentation" terminology
   (search required broader approach)

2. Implementation complexity and scalability challenges noted across papers
   (need to design practical deployment strategies)

3. Privacy vs. monitoring tradeoff mentioned in identity-based approaches
   (requires careful policy design)

4. Model drift and adversarial attacks on ML-based detection systems
   (need robust validation frameworks)

5. Legacy system integration not well covered
