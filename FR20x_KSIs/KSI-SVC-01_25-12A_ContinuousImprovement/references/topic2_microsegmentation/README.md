## Key Takeaways

1. **Zero-Trust is Essential**: The foundation for all modern microsegmentation approaches
2. **ML/AI Enables Adaptation**: Continual learning allows systems to adapt to new threats
3. **Identity-Based Approach**: Modern segmentation focuses on who (identity) not where (network location)
4. **Policy Formalization**: Formal methods ensure policies are correct and can be verified
5. **Distributed Systems**: Microsegmentation must work across edge-cloud architectures
6. **Real-Time Detection**: ML models must detect threats in real-time with low false positive rates

## Notes and Observations

### Research Gaps
- Limited research specifically on "adaptive microsegmentation" terminology (broader term searches more effective)
- Implementation complexity and scalability challenges underexplored
- Legacy system integration patterns not well documented

### Opportunities
- Practical deployment frameworks needed
- Open-source implementations lacking
- Standardization efforts recommended
- Performance benchmarking frameworks needed

### Recommendations
- Review Phase 1 papers (see RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md) first
- Focus on 2024-2025 papers for latest approaches
- Combine theoretical papers (policy design) with practical papers (implementations)
- Study real-world lessons from 2508.01863 and 2501.09033
