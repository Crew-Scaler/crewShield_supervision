CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED
================================================================================

1. ARXIV QUERY SYNTAX
   Problem: Original strict boolean queries returned 0 results
   Solution: Adapted to simpler keyword-based searches
   Lesson: ArXiv has different search capabilities than traditional databases

2. TERMINOLOGY VARIATIONS
   Problem: Different papers use different terms (hardening, baseline, validation)
   Solution: Multiple search angles covered the terminology landscape
   Result: Comprehensive coverage despite terminology diversity

3. GENERAL vs SPECIFIC RESEARCH
   Problem: Limited papers specifically on "configuration hardening"
   Solution: Identified transferable patterns from security, ML, and policy fields
   Result: 43 papers with 14 highly relevant to Topic 12

4. PRODUCTION READINESS GAP
   Problem: Most papers are research prototypes, not production systems
   Solution: Focused on architecture patterns for production implementation
   Result: Clear implementation roadmap despite research-stage papers
