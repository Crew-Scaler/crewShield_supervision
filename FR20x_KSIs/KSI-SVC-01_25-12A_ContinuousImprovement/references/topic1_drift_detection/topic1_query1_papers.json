    "title": "Evasion-Resilient Detection of DNS-over-HTTPS Data Exfiltration: A Practical Evaluation and Toolkit",
    "summary": "The purpose of this project is to assess how well defenders can detect DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) file exfiltration, and which evasion strategies can be used by attackers. While providing a reproducible toolkit to generate, intercept and analyze DoH exfiltration, and comparing Machine Learning vs threshold-based detection under adversarial scenarios. The originality of this project is the introduction of an end-to-end, containerized pipeline that generates configurable file exfiltration over DoH using several parameters (e.g., chunking, encoding, padding, resolver rotation). It allows for file reconstruction at the resolver side, while extracting flow-level features using a fork of DoHLyzer. The pipeline contains a prediction side, which allows the training of machine learning models based on public labelled datasets and then evaluates them side-by-side with threshold-based detection methods against malicious and evasive DNS-Over-HTTPS traffic. We train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression classifiers on a public DoH dataset and benchmark them against evasive DoH exfiltration scenarios. The toolkit orchestrates traffic generation, file capture, feature extraction, model training and analysis. The toolkit is then encapsulated into several Docker containers for easy setup and full reproducibility regardless of the platform it is run on. Future research regarding this project is directed at validating the results on mixed enterprise traffic, extending the protocol coverage to HTTP/3/QUIC request, adding a benign traffic generation, and working on real-time traffic evaluation. A key objective is to quantify when stealth constraints make DoH exfiltration uneconomical and unworthy for the attacker.",

    "title": "Holographic entanglement negativity and thermodynamics in backreacted AdS black hole",
    "summary": "We investigate holographic entanglement negativity (HEN) as a probe of mixed state quantum correlations in a deformed AdS black hole background with backreaction sourced by a string cloud. The bulk geometry is dual to a strongly coupled large-$N_c$ gauge theory at finite temperature, backreacted by a finite density of heavy static fundamental quarks. Alongside holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), we analyze entanglement thermodynamics and establish a first law like relation in the small backreaction regime by identifying the deformed black hole at zero temperature as the natural ground state of the dual field theory. Using analytic expansions in the low and high temperature limits, we compute the HEN for adjacent, disjoint and bipartite subsystem configurations and examine its dependence on the backreaction parameter $\u03c1$. Our results reveal a clear regime dependence: at low temperature, backreaction suppresses the negativity, signaling a reduction of distillable quantum correlations while at high temperature the negativity is enhanced due to the monotonic $\u03c1$-dependence of near horizon contributions. We further compare the behavior of HEN with HEE and mutual information, demonstrating that entanglement negativity provides a sharper diagnostic of the competition between thermal and quantum correlations in holographic plasmas with matter backreaction.",

    "title": "DeepONet-accelerated Bayesian inversion for moving boundary problems",
    "summary": "This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.   The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.",

    "title": "Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Elemental Systems",
    "summary": "The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.",

    "summary": "We develop a unified framework for computing R\u00e9nyi and entanglement entropies of arbitrary spacetime intervals in time-dependent states of $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories. By combining the spacetime density matrix formalism with the replica method, we show that entanglement entropy is well defined for both spacelike and timelike separations. Applying this framework to global quenches prepared by boundary states and to local quenches generated by operator insertions, we obtain analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy in general spacetime configurations. The results reveal qualitative differences between spacelike and timelike intervals: the timelike entanglement entropy is time-independent in the global quench model, depends solely on the temporal separation, and universally exhibits a constant imaginary contribution. These features are naturally explained by a generalized quasiparticle picture in which entanglement is produced precisely when one worldline of each quasiparticle pair intersects the interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear sum rule relating time- and spacelike entanglement persists in both global and local quenches, indicating a broader universality of spacetime entanglement in real-time quantum dynamics.",

    "summary": "We propose a ground state entanglement probe for gapped, two-dimensional quantum many-body systems that involves taking powers of reduced density matrices in a particular geometric configuration. This quantity, which we denote by $\u03c9_{\u03b1,\u03b2}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $\u03b1, \u03b2$, and can be seen as a ``R\u00e9nyi-like\" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $\u03c9_{\u03b1,\u03b2}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $\u03c9_{\u03b1,\u03b2}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $\u03b1$ and $\u03b2$, our quantity $\u03c9_{\u03b1,\u03b2}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $\u03c9_{\u03b1,\u03b2}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments.",

    "title": "LightTact: A Visual-Tactile Fingertip Sensor for Deformation-Independent Contact Sensing",
    "summary": "Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.",

    "title": "Eckart heat-flux applicability in $F(\u03a6,X)R$ theories and the existence of temperature gradients",
    "summary": "We show that in single--scalar theories of the form $\\mathcal{L}=F(\u03a6,X)R+G(\u03a6,X)$, a generic nonminimal coupling $F(\u03a6,X)$ induces, in the scalar--comoving frame, an additional transverse contribution to the effective heat flux, proportional to $(F_X/8\u03c0F)V_{\\perp a}$, where $V_a \\equiv h_a{}^c\\nabla_c\\nabla_d X\\,u^d$ and $V_{\\perp a}$ denotes the component orthogonal to the 4--acceleration $a_a$. This new term, that is not present in $F(\u03a6)R$ scalar-tensor theories, cannot in general be written as a spatial temperature gradient, and therefore obstructs a standard Eckart interpretation of the scalar sector for arbitrary timelike scalar configurations. As a result, requiring an Eckart heat flux $q_a = -K\\bigl(D_a T_g + T_g\\, a_a\\bigr)$ for all such configurations is possible if and only if $F_X(\u03a6,X)\\equiv 0$, i.e.\\ $F(\u03a6,X)=F(\u03a6)$, resulting in a theory that is a subclass of Horndeski. Thus, only Jordan--like theories of the type $F(\u03a6)R+G(\u03a6,X)$ admit a global Eckart fluid picture of the scalar sector, while models with $F_X\\neq 0$ can recover an Eckart--like form only on highly symmetric backgrounds where the transverse contribution vanishes or collapses to a single gradient direction. We also make a brief comment on the existence of temperature gradients $D_aT_g$.",

    "summary": "Controlled assembly of active-passive colloidal mixtures offers a route to reconfigurable microscale machines, but their self-assembly pathways remain poorly understood. We study the directed assembly of metallo-dielectric Janus particles (JPs) and passive polystyrene (PS) beads using optoelectrically reconfigurable AC-field patterning, which allows precise control over particle composition and binding sequence. Through experiments, analytical modeling, and simulations, we show that dipolar interactions drive robust JP-JP and JP-PS dimer formation with frequency-dependent stability. At intermediate and high frequencies, JP-PS binding is strongly attractive, whereas at low frequencies it becomes effectively repulsive due to electrical double-layer screening and electrohydrodynamic flows at the metallic hemisphere. In multi-particle systems, PS beads act as cooperative hubs that hierarchically recruit JPs, yielding higher-order hybrid structures. We identify structural isomers - for example, 3JP + 1PS clusters can form chain-like or triangular configurations depending on assembly sequence. Simulations confirm both as equilibrium states, with the triangular isomer slightly more stable. Similar polymorphism appears in larger clusters (4JPs). Overall, we establish a framework for controlled active-passive colloidal assembly, showing how frequency-tunable interactions and structural polymorphism enable the design of reconfigurable colloidal machines for applications in microrobotics, targeted delivery, and adaptive materials.",

    "title": "Effect of discreteness on domain wall stability in a plate coupled to a foundation of bistable elements",
    "summary": "Surfaces and structures capable of multiple stable configurations have attracted growing interest for on-demand shape morphing. In this work, we consider an elastic compliant plate coupled to a two-dimensional foundation comprising an array of bistable elements, a system that can form and retain complex continuous morphologies without sustained actuation via creation of stable domain walls separating regions in different stable states. These domain walls exhibit three distinct behaviors: expansion, shrinking, and metastable pinning. These arise from two limits of foundation discreteness. In the continuum limit, where bistable units are strongly coupled, domain walls undergo global phase transitions analogous to first-order phase transitions. In the anti-continuum limit, discreteness introduces Peierls-Nabarro-type energy modulations that lead to metastable pinning. To quantify these behaviors and the transition between the two limits, we develop a reduced-order model that captures the total potential energy of configurations with domain walls and validate it using finite element analysis (FEA). For axisymmetric domain walls, the model yields phase diagrams identifying the regimes of expansion, shrinking, and pinning as functions of bistable-potential asymmetry, relative foundation discreteness, and domain-wall size. We then extend the analysis to non-axisymmetric geometries and establish local geometric criteria that predict the stability of convex and concave polygonal domain walls, confirmed by simulations. Together, these results clarify how discreteness enables stability through energy-landscape modulation, provide predictive design rules for multistable reconfigurable surfaces, and offer insights into domain-wall stability more generally in elastically coupled multistable metamaterials.",
