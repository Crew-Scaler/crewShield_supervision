## Limitations & Notes

1. **Search Bias:** ArXiv searches returned some papers on unrelated topics (physics, bioinformatics) due to keyword matching in abstracts. These were ranked lower by the relevance algorithm.

2. **Direct Relevance:** While many papers address monitoring and anomaly detection, fewer directly address "configuration drift" as a primary focus. Most are applicable methodologically.

3. **2025 Papers:** Most downloaded papers are from December 2025 (very recent), providing latest methodologies.

4. **Infrastructure Tools:** Several papers mention specific tools:
   - K3s (lightweight Kubernetes)
   - WireGuard (VPN)
   - Docker (containerization)
   - Databricks (data platform)

## Recommendations for Further Research

1. Focus on Tier 1 papers (Holoscope, Domain Adaptation in SHM, Time-Vertex ML)
2. Explore machine learning approaches from Tier 2 papers
3. Investigate edge-cloud collaboration patterns from CoDrone
4. Review infrastructure automation in Declarative Language for LLM Workflows
5. Consider privacy aspects from Differentially Private Feature Release paper
