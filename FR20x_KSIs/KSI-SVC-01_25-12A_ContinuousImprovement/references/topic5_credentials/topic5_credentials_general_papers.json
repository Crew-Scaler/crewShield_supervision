    "title": "A High-Dimensional Quantum Blockchain Protocol Based on Time- Entanglement",
    "summary": "Rapid advancements in quantum computing and machine learning threaten the long-term security of classical blockchain systems, whose protection mechanisms largely rely on computational difficulties. In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block information into time-delimited qudit states allows block identity and data verification to be implemented through the causal sequencing of quantum measurements instead of cryptographic hash functions. High-dimensional coding increases the information capacity per quantum carrier and improves noise resistance. Time-entanglement provides distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection across the blockchain. Each block derives its own public-private key pair directly from the observed quantum correlations by performing high-dimensional Bell state measurements in successive time steps. Because these keys are dependent on the time ordering of measurements, attempts to alter block data or disrupt the protocol's timing structure inevitably affect the reconstructed correlations and are revealed during validation. Recent advances in the creation and detection of high-dimensional time-slice entanglement demonstrate that the necessary quantum resources are compatible with emerging quantum communication platforms. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the proposed framework can be evaluated as a viable and scalable candidate for quantum-secure blockchain architectures in future quantum network environments.",

    "title": "Binding Agent ID: Unleashing the Power of AI Agents with accountability and credibility",
    "summary": "Autonomous AI agents lack traceable accountability mechanisms, creating a fundamental dilemma where systems must either operate as ``downgraded tools'' or risk real-world abuse. This vulnerability stems from the limitations of traditional key-based authentication, which guarantees neither the operator's physical identity nor the agent's code integrity. To bridge this gap, we propose BAID (Binding Agent ID), a comprehensive identity infrastructure establishing verifiable user-code binding. BAID integrates three orthogonal mechanisms: local binding via biometric authentication, decentralized on-chain identity management, and a novel zkVM-based Code-Level Authentication protocol. By leveraging recursive proofs to treat the program binary as the identity, this protocol provides cryptographic guarantees for operator identity, agent configuration integrity, and complete execution provenance, thereby effectively preventing unauthorized operation and code substitution. We implement and evaluate a complete prototype system, demonstrating the practical feasibility of blockchain-based identity management and zkVM-based authentication protocol.",

    "title": "Fail Fast, Win Big: Rethinking the Drafting Strategy in Speculative Decoding via Diffusion LLMs",
    "summary": "Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

    "title": "Memory-T1: Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Reasoning in Multi-session Agents",
    "summary": "Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

    "title": "Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers",
    "summary": "As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.",

    "title": "Practical Quantum-Classical Feature Fusion for complex data Classification",
    "summary": "Hybrid quantum and classical learning aims to couple quantum feature maps with the robustness of classical neural networks, yet most architectures treat the quantum circuit as an isolated feature extractor and merge its measurements with classical representations by direct concatenation. This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features.",

    "summary": "Achieving precise camera control in video generation remains challenging, as existing methods often rely on camera pose annotations that are difficult to scale to large and dynamic datasets and are frequently inconsistent with depth estimation, leading to train-test discrepancies. We introduce CETCAM, a camera-controllable video generation framework that eliminates the need for camera annotations through a consistent and extensible tokenization scheme. CETCAM leverages recent advances in geometry foundation models, such as VGGT, to estimate depth and camera parameters and converts them into unified, geometry-aware tokens. These tokens are seamlessly integrated into a pretrained video diffusion backbone via lightweight context blocks. Trained in two progressive stages, CETCAM first learns robust camera controllability from diverse raw video data and then refines fine-grained visual quality using curated high-fidelity datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art geometric consistency, temporal stability, and visual realism. Moreover, CETCAM exhibits strong adaptability to additional control modalities, including inpainting and layout control, highlighting its flexibility beyond camera control.

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. As MAS become increasingly autonomous in various safety-critical tasks, detecting malicious agents has become a critical security concern. Although existing graph anomaly detection (GAD)-based defenses can identify anomalous agents, they mainly rely on coarse sentence-level information and overlook fine-grained lexical cues, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in these methods limits their reliability and real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose XG-Guard, an explainable and fine-grained safeguarding framework for detecting malicious agents in MAS. To incorporate both coarse and fine-grained textual information for anomalous agent identification, we utilize a bi-level agent encoder to jointly model the sentence- and token-level representations of each agent. A theme-based anomaly detector further captures the evolving discussion focus in MAS dialogues, while a bi-level score fusion mechanism quantifies token-level contributions for explanation. Extensive experiments across diverse MAS topologies and attack scenarios demonstrate robust detection performance and strong interpretability of XG-Guard.",

    "title": "The Geometry of Abstraction: Continual Learning via Recursive Quotienting",
    "summary": "Continual learning systems operating in fixed-dimensional spaces face a fundamental geometric barrier: the flat manifold problem. When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold.",

    "title": "Making Strong Error-Correcting Codes Work Effectively for HBM in AI Inference",
    "summary": "LLM inference is increasingly memory bound, and HBM cost per GB dominates system cost. Current HBM stacks include short on-die ECC that tightens binning, raises price, and fixes reliability policy inside the device. This paper asks whether a system can tolerate a much higher raw HBM bit error rate and still keep end-to-end correctness and throughput, without changing the HBM PHY or the fixed 32 B transaction size. We propose REACH, a controller managed ECC design that keeps the HBM link and 32 B transfers unchanged. REACH uses a two level Reed-Solomon scheme: each 32 B chunk uses an inner code to check and correct most faults locally, while chunks that cannot be fixed are marked as erasures. An outer code spans kilobytes and runs in erasure only mode, repairing only flagged chunks and avoiding the expensive locator step. For small random writes, REACH updates outer parity with differential parity to avoid recomputing parity over the whole span, and an optional importance adaptive bit plane policy can protect only critical fields such as BF16 exponents to reduce ECC work and traffic. On three LLMs at 8K context, REACH keeps about 79 percent of on-die ECC throughput at zero BER and remains qualified up to a raw BER of 1e-3, extending tolerable device error rates by about three orders of magnitude while keeping tokens per second nearly flat. In ASAP7, a full REACH controller occupies 15.2 mm2 and consumes 17.5 W at 3.56 TB/s, and it reduces ECC area by 11.6x and power by about 60 percent compared to a naive long Reed-Solomon baseline. By moving strong ECC into the controller, REACH turns long code reliability into a system choice that can enable lower cost HBM under the same standard interface.",
