  "summary": "We present AuthGuard, a comprehensive zero-trust authentication framework designed specifically for autonomous AI agents operating in cloud infrastructure. The system implements ephemeral credential management, agent-to-agent verification protocols, and real-time lateral movement detection. Our evaluation across 1000+ agent workflows demonstrates 99.2% detection accuracy for unauthorized access attempts.",
