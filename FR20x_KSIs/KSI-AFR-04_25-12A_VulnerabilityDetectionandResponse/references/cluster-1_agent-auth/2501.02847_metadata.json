  "summary": "Service accounts are critical components of cloud security but remain vulnerable to credential theft. This paper presents a machine learning-based detection system that identifies compromised service accounts through API call pattern analysis. Our model achieves 96.5% precision on Google Cloud's real-world datasets.",
