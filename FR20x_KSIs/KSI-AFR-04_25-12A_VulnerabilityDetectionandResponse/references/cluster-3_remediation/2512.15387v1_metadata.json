  "summary": "Intelligent electronics are deeply embedded in critical infrastructures and must remain reliable, particularly against deliberate attacks. To minimize risks and impede remote compromise, sensitive systems can be physically isolated from external networks, forming an airgap. Yet, airgaps can still be infiltrated by capable adversaries gaining code execution. Prior research has shown that attackers can then attempt to wirelessly exfiltrate data across the airgap by exploiting unintended radio emis...",
