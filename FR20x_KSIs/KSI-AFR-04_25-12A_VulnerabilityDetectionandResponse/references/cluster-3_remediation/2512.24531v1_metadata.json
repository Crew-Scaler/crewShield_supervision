  "summary": "This paper proposes an alternative approach to formally establishing the correctness of the RSA public key cryptosystem. The methodology presented herein deviates slightly from conventional proofs found in existing literature. Specifically, this study explores the conditions under which the choice of the positive integer N, a fundamental component of RSA, can be extended beyond the standard selection criteria. We derive explicit conditions that determine when certain values of N are valid for th...",
