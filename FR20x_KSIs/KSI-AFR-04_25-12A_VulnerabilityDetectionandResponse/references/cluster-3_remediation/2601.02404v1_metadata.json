  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, including software development, education, and technical assistance. Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \\texts...",
