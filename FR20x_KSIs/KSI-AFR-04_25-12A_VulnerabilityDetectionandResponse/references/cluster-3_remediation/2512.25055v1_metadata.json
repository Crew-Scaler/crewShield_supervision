  "summary": "This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intel...",
