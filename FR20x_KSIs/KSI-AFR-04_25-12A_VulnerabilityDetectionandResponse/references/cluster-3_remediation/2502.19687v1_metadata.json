  "summary": "The advent of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) has marked a significant shift towards intelligent transportation, with implications for public safety and traffic efficiency. While these systems integrate a variety of technologies and offer numerous benefits, their security is paramount, as vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for safety and trust. This study aims to systematically investigate potential security weaknesses in the codebases of prominent open-source ADS projects using CodeQ...",
