  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating software vulnerability analysis, a critical task given the impact of security failure of modern software systems. However, current approaches in using LLMs to automate vulnerability analysis mostly rely on using online API-based LLM services, requiring the user to disclose the source code in development. Moreover, they predominantly frame the task as a binary classification(vulnerable or not vulnerable), limiting potential pract...",
