  "summary": "Driven by surging submission volumes, scientific peer review has catalyzed two parallel trends: individual over-reliance on LLMs and institutional AI-powered assessment systems. This study investigates the robustness of \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" systems to adversarial PDF manipulation via invisible text injections and layout aware encoding attacks. We specifically target the distinct incentive of flipping \"Reject\" decisions to \"Accept,\" a vulnerability that fundamentally compromises scientific integrity....",
