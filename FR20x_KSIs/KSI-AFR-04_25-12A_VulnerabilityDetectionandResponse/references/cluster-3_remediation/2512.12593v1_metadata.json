  "summary": "The increasing reliance on software in various applications has made the problem of software vulnerability detection more critical. Software vulnerabilities can lead to security breaches, data theft, and other negative outcomes. Traditional software vulnerability detection techniques, such as static and dynamic analysis, have been shown to be ineffective at detecting multiple vulnerabilities.   To address this issue, this study employed a deep learning approach, specifically Convolutional Neural...",
