  "summary": "While the importance of efficient recycling is widely acknowledged, accurately determining the recyclability of items and their proper disposal remains a complex task for the general public. In this study, we explore the application of cutting-edge vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude 3.5) for predicting the recyclability of commonly disposed items. Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including...",
