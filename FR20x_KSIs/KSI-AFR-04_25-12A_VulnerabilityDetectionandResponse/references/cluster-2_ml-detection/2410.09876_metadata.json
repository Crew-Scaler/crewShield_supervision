  "summary": "We introduce DeepVulnDetect, a deep learning model for detecting software vulnerabilities in source code. Using a transformer-based architecture trained on 100K+ vulnerable code samples, our model achieves 89.3% precision on zero-day vulnerabilities. The model processes 1M lines of code per minute.",
