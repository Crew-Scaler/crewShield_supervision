  "summary": "Many modern AI and ML problems require evaluating partners' contributions through shared yet asymmetric, computationally intensive processes and the simultaneous selection of the most beneficial candidates. Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the high...",
