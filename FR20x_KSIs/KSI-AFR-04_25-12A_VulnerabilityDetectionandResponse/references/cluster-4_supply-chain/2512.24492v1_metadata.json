  "summary": "Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classificat...",
