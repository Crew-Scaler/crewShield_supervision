  "summary": "Timing side-channels are an important threat to cryptography that still needs to be addressed in implementations, and the advent of post-quantum cryptography raises this issue because the lattice-based schemes may produce secret-dependent timing variability with the help of complex arithmetic and control flow. Since also real timing measurements are affected by environmental noise (e.g. scheduling effects, contention, heavy tailed delays), in this work a scenario-based statistical risk model is ...",
