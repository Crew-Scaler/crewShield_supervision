  "summary": "Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) is a life-threatening obstetric complication involving abnormal placental invasion into the uterine wall. Early and accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential to reduce maternal and neonatal risks. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning framework that enhances PAS detection by integrating multiple imaging modalities. A multimodal deep learning model was designed using an intermediate feature-level fusion architecture combining 3D Magnetic Resonance...",
