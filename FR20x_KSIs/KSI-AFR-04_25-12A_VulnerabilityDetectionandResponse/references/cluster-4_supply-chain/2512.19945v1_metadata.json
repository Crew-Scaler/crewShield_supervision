  "summary": "Securing Internet of Things (IoT) firmware remains difficult due to proprietary binaries, stripped symbols, heterogeneous architectures, and limited access to executable code. Existing analysis methods, such as static analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing, depend on binary visibility and functional emulation, making them unreliable when firmware is encrypted or inaccessible. To address this limitation, we propose a binary-free, architecture-agnostic solution that estimates the likelihood of ...",
