  "summary": "Many location-based services rely on a point-in-polygon test (PiP), checking whether a point or a trajectory lies inside a geographic zone. Since geometric operations are expensive in zero-knowledge proofs, privately performing the PiP test is challenging. In this paper, we answer the research questions of how different ways of encoding zones affect accuracy and proof cost by exploiting gridbased lookup tables under a fixed STARK execution model. Beyond a Boolean grid-based baseline that marks c...",
