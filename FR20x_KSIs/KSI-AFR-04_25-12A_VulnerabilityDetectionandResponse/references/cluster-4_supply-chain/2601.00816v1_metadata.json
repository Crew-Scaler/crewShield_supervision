  "summary": "Contemporary AI systems achieve extraordinary performance yet remain opaque and non-verifiable, creating a crisis of trust for safety-critical deployment. We introduce MathLedger, a substrate for verifiable machine cognition that integrates formal verification, cryptographic attestation, and learning dynamics into a single epistemic loop. The system implements Reflexive Formal Learning (RFL), a symbolic analogue of gradient descent where updates are driven by verifier outcomes rather than statis...",
