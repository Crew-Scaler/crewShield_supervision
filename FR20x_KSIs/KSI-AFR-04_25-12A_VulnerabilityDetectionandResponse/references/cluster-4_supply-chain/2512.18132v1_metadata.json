  "summary": "Edge AI inference is becoming prevalent thanks to the emergence of small yet high-performance microprocessors. This shift from cloud to edge processing brings several benefits in terms of energy savings, improved latency, and increased privacy. On the downside, bringing computation to the edge makes them more vulnerable to physical side-channel attacks (SCA), which aim to extract the confidentiality of neural network models, e.g., architecture and weight. To address this growing threat, we propo...",
