  "summary": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for future wireless networks by prioritizing task-relevant meaning over raw data delivery, thereby reducing communication overhead and improving efficiency. However, shifting from bit-accurate transmission to task-oriented delivery introduces new security and privacy risks. These include semantic leakage, semantic manipulation, knowledge base vulnerabilities, model-related attacks, and threats to authenticity and availability. M...",
