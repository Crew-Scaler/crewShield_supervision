  "summary": "Autonomous AI agents lack traceable accountability mechanisms, creating a fundamental dilemma where systems must either operate as ``downgraded tools'' or risk real-world abuse. This vulnerability stems from the limitations of traditional key-based authentication, which guarantees neither the operator's physical identity nor the agent's code integrity. To bridge this gap, we propose BAID (Binding Agent ID), a comprehensive identity infrastructure establishing verifiable user-code binding. BAID i...",
