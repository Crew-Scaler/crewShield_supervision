  "summary": "Document forgery poses a growing threat to legal, economic, and governmental processes, requiring increasingly sophisticated verification mechanisms. One approach involves the use of plausibility checks, rule-based procedures that assess the correctness and internal consistency of data, to detect anomalies or signs of manipulation. Although these verification procedures are essential for ensuring data integrity, existing plausibility checks are manually implemented by software engineers, which i...",
