  "summary": "This paper presents a novel workload identity federation protocol optimized for multi-agent AI systems. We address the challenge of managing short-lived ephemeral credentials across distributed agent networks while maintaining strict least-privilege access control. Our federated identity model reduces credential lifetime from hours to milliseconds.",
