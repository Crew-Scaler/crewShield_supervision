  "summary": "The convergence of Information Technology and Operational Technology has exposed Industrial Control Systems to adaptive, intelligent adversaries that render static defenses obsolete. This paper introduces the Adversarial Resilience Co-evolution (ARC) framework, addressing the \"Trinity of Trust\" comprising model fidelity, data integrity, and analytical resilience. ARC establishes a co-evolutionary arms race within a Fortified Secure Digital Twin (F-SCDT), where a Deep Reinforcement Learning \"Red ...",
