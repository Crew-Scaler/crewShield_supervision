  "summary": "Existing research on generative AI security is primarily driven by mutually reinforcing attack and defense methodologies grounded in empirical experience. This dynamic frequently gives rise to previously unknown attacks that can circumvent current detection and prevention. This necessitates the continual updating of security mechanisms. Constructing generative AI with provable security and theoretically controllable risk is therefore necessary. Consensus Sampling (CS) is a promising algorithm to...",
