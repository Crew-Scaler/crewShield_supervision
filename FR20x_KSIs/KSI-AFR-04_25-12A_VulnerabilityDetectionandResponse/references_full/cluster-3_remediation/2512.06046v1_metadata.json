  "summary": "We present AI4UI, a framework of autonomous front-end development agents purpose-built to meet the rigorous requirements of enterprise-grade application delivery. Unlike general-purpose code assistants designed for rapid prototyping, AI4UI focuses on production readiness delivering secure, scalable, compliant, and maintainable UI code integrated seamlessly into enterprise workflows. AI4UI operates with targeted human-in-the-loop involvement: at the design stage, developers embed a Gen-AI-friendl...",
