  "summary": "Autonomous vehicles, including self driving cars, ground robots, and drones, rely on multi-modal sensor pipelines for safe operation, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial sensor attacks. A critical gap is the lack of a systematic end-to-end view of how sensor induced errors traverse interconnected modules to affect the physical world. To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive survey across platforms, sensing modalities, attack methods, and countermeasures. At its core is \\Model (\\modelAbbr),...",
