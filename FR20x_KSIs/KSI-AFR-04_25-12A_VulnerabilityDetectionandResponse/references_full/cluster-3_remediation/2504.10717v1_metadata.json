  "summary": "Fuzz testing to find semantic control vulnerabilities is an essential activity to evaluate the robustness of autonomous driving (AD) software. Whilst there is a preponderance of disparate fuzzing tools that target different parts of the test environment, such as the scenario, sensors, and vehicle dynamics, there is a lack of fuzzing strategies that ensemble these fuzzers to enable concurrent fuzzing, utilizing diverse techniques and targets. This research proposes FuzzSense, a modular, black-box...",
