  "summary": "The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural ...",
