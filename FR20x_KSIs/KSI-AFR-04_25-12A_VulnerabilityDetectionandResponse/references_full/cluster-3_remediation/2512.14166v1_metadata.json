  "summary": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has led to the adoption of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard for discovering and invoking external tools. While this architecture decouples the reasoning engine from tool execution to enhance scalability, it introduces a significant privacy surface: third-party MCP servers, acting as semi-honest intermediaries, can observe detailed tool interaction logs outside the user's trusted boundary. In this paper, we f...",
