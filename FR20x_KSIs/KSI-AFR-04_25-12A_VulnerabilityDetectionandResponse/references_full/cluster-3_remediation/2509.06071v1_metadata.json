  "summary": "High-definition maps provide precise environmental information essential for prediction and planning in autonomous driving systems. Due to the high cost of labeling and maintenance, recent research has turned to online HD map construction using onboard sensor data, offering wider coverage and more timely updates for autonomous vehicles. However, the robustness of online map construction under adversarial conditions remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic vulnerability analy...",
