  "summary": "Static Application Security Testing (SAST) enables organizations to detect vulnerabilities in code early; however, major SAST platforms do not include visual aids and present little insight on correlations between tainted data chains. We propose VIVID - Vulnerability Information Via Data flow - a novel method to extract and consume SAST insights, which is to graph the application's vulnerability data flows (VDFs) and carry out graph theory analysis on the resulting VDF directed graph.
