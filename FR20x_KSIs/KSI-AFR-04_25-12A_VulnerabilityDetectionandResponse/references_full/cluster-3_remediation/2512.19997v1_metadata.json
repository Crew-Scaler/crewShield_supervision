  "summary": "Broken Access Control (BAC) violations, which consistently rank among the top five security risks in the OWASP API Security Top 10, refer to unauthorized access attempts arising from BAC vulnerabilities, whose successful exploitation can impose significant risks on exposed application programming interfaces (APIs). In recent years, learning-based methods have demonstrated promising prospects in detecting various types of malicious activities. However, in real-network operation and maintenance sc...",
