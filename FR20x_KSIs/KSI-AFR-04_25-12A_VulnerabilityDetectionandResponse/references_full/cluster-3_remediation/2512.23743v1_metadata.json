  "summary": "Clinical coding automation using cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) poses privacy risks and latency bottlenecks, rendering them unsuitable for on-premise healthcare deployment. We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic...",
