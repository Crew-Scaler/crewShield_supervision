  "summary": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is a vital component of remote biometric authentication systems based on facial recognition, increasingly used across web-based applications. Among emerging threats, video injection attacks -- facilitated by technologies such as deepfakes and virtual camera software -- pose significant challenges to system integrity. While virtual camera detection (VCD) has shown potential as a countermeasure, existing literature offers limited insight into its practical implementation a...",
