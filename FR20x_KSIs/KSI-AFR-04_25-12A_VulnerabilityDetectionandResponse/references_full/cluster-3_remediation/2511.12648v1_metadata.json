  "summary": "The security of autonomous vehicle networks is facing major challenges, owing to the complexity of sensor integration, real-time performance demands, and distributed communication protocols that expose vast attack surfaces around both individual and network-wide safety. Existing security schemes are unable to provide sub-10 ms (milliseconds) anomaly detection and distributed coordination of large-scale networks of vehicles within an acceptable safety/privacy framework. This paper introduces a th...",
