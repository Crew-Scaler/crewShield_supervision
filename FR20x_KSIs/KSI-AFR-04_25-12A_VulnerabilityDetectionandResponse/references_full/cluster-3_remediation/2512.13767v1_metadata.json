  "summary": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as unmanned aerial vehicles are vulnerable to slow degradation that develops without causing immediate or obvious failures. Small sensor biases or timing irregularities can accumulate over time, gradually reducing stability while standard monitoring mechanisms continue to report normal operation. Detecting this early phase of degradation remains a challenge, as most existing approaches focus on abrupt faults or visible trajectory deviations. This paper introduce...",
