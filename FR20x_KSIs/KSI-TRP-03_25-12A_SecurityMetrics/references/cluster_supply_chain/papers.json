    "title": "Out-of-Band Power Side-Channel Detection for Semiconductor Supply Chain Integrity at Scale",
    "summary": "Out-of-band screening of microcontrollers is a major gap in semiconductor supply chain security. High-assurance techniques such as X-ray and destructive reverse engineering are accurate but slow and expensive, hindering comprehensive detection for hardware Trojans or firmware tampering. Consequently, there has been increased interest in applying machine learning techniques to automate forensic examination, enabling rapid, large-scale inspection of components without manual oversight. We introduce a non-destructive screening method that uses power side-channel measurements and generative modeling to detect tampering in commodity microcontrollers without trusted hardware. As a proof-of-concept, differential power analysis (DPA) traces are collected from the ChipWhisperer and a generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained only on benign measurements to learn nominal power behavior. The trained discriminator then serves as a one-class anomaly detector. We report detection performance on multiple tampering scenarios and discuss how this technique can serve as an intermediate screening tier between basic functional tests and high-cost forensic analysis. The proposed method is evaluated in the context of semiconductor supply chain practice and policy to assess its suitability as an intermediate assurance mechanism.",

    "title": "LLA: Enhancing Security and Privacy for Generative Models with Logic-Locked Accelerators",
    "summary": "We introduce LLA, an effective intellectual property (IP) protection scheme for generative AI models. LLA leverages the synergy between hardware and software to defend against various supply chain threats, including model theft, model corruption, and information leakage. On the software side, it embeds key bits into neurons that can trigger outliers to degrade performance and applies invariance transformations to obscure the key values. On the hardware side, it integrates a lightweight locking module into the AI accelerator while maintaining compatibility with various dataflow patterns and toolchains. An accelerator with a pre-stored secret key acts as a license to access the model services provided by the IP owner. The evaluation results show that LLA can withstand a broad range of oracle-guided key optimization attacks, while incurring a minimal computational overhead of less than 0.1% for 7,168 key bits.",

    "title": "A Blockchain-Monitored Agentic AI Architecture for Trusted Perception-Reasoning-Action Pipelines",
    "summary": "The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.",
